  Abstract: >-
    The article discusses the concepts of micro-rhythmic gestures in hip hop and
    rap music. It presents an investigation which aims to explore the
    relationship between the meaning of rhythm and micro-rhythmic timing. It
    describes rap music as having a repetitive beat and flow and a loud babbling
    voice on top of the groove. It mentions that hip hop music is compose of
    rhythmic movements, rhymes, and metaphorical language. It further stresses
    that micro-rhythmic gestures are significant to the rhetorical appearance of
    rap music and the self-understanding of hip hop culture.

  Abstract: >-
    The relationship between music and language is fiercely debated in the
    modern literature of neuroscience and music. Here, we argue that a
    musicological study of online communication between jazz musicians in
    combination with brain imaging studies offers a unique setting for
    evaluating communicational aspects of music practices that rarely enter the
    present discourse on the subject. We employ Miles Davis' quintet of the
    1960s and its use of polyrhythmic structures as a general example of a jazz
    group focusing on communication. First, we consider jazz in the light of
    Roman Jakobson's model of communication in a broad perspective. Next, we
    analyze polyrhythmic occurrences in Herbie Hancock's solo on the jazz
    standard "All of You" as an example of how this communication develops as a
    narrative structuring of tension and relief. We identify two typical types
    of polyrhythms, metric displacement and regrouping of subdivisions. Finally,
    we show how these polyrhythmic structures employ brain areas hitherto
    associated with linguistic semantic processing, and discuss possible
    implications.

  Abstract: >-
    Music is experienced and understood on the basis of foreground/background
    relationships and tension created between actual music and the underlying
    meter. Polyrhythms create tension between a counter meter and the main
    meter. Previously, we have shown that Brodmann area 47 (BA47), a brain area
    associated with processing of language, is activated bilaterally when
    musicians tap the main meter in a polymetric context emphasizing a counter
    meter, suggesting that processing of metric elements in music relies on
    brain areas also involved in language processing. In that study, the tension
    was created entirely by changes in the stimulus while participants were
    tapping the main meter. Here we find left-hemispheric BA47 activation in
    response to a self-produced counter meter on top of a main meter provided by
    an ecological music excerpt. This data indicates that the activation is
    linked to polyrhythmic tension, regardless of whether it arises from the
    stimulus or the task.

  Abstract: >-
    Music is experienced and understood on the basis of foreground/background
    relationships created between actual music and the underlying meter. In
    contemporary styles of music so-called polyrhythmic, structures hence create
    tension between a counter pulse and the main pulse. This exerts a marked
    influence on the listener, particularly when the experience of the original
    meter is maintained during the counter pulse. We here demonstrate that
    Brodmann area 47, an area associated with higher processing of language, is
    activated bilaterally when musicians tap the main pulse in a polymetric
    context where the music emphasizes a counter meter. This suggests that the
    processing of metric elements of music relies on brain areas also involved
    in language comprehension. We propose that BA47 is involved in general
    neuronal processing of temporal coherence subserving both language and
    music.

  Abstract: >-
    Musicians constantly communicate auditorily when playing together in order
    to create their musical artwork. In jazz, as in most other musical styles,
    rhythm is one of the major trajectories for communication, and the tension
    created by polyrhythm/polymeter is arguably one of the strongest rhythmic
    means and a strong attractor of attention. A graphical overview of the
    polyrhythmic occurrences in piano, bass, and drums in a piano solo by Herbie
    Hancock demonstrates two main types of polyrhythm: metric displacement and
    regrouping of subdivisions and their usage. By examining neural processing
    of the different types of polyrhythmic structures, the following hypotheses
    are posed: (1) Neural processing of metric incongruences differ in
    lateralization and strength between musicians and non-musicians at the
    pre-attentive level; (2) Processing of metric incongruence is consistent
    with a predictive coding framework, i.e., lower level brain areas estimate
    predictions of their expected input based on contextual information from
    higher level areas; and (3) Neural processing of polyrhythms are
    co-localized with areas of language processing in musicians.

  Abstract: >-
    Musical rhythm, consisting of apparently abstract intervals of accented
    temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. How
    does the cognitive system enable our experiences of rhythmically complex
    music? In this paper, we describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity
    in music and propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework for
    understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain.
    We also consider why we feel so compelled by rhythmic tension in music.
    First, we consider theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide
    hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second, we present
    the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical organization of brain
    responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated
    with predicting future events. According to this theory, perception and
    learning is manifested through the brain’s Bayesian minimization of the
    error between the input to the brain and the brain’s prior expectations.
    Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm, in which rhythm perception
    is conceptualized as an interaction between what is heard (“rhythm”) and the
    brain’s anticipatory structuring of music (“meter”). Finally, we review
    empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation,
    polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special
    cases of the PC theory. We argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain’s
    general principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire for
    sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a result of such
    mechanisms

  Abstract: "The term style is often used in discussions of music, as indeed it is used in discussions and assessments of. many areas of life. In fact, we often use the term life-style to designate a particular mode and manner °f existence. To attach the word style to a given phenomenon or set of phe- nomena is to suggest that it possesses something that is distinctive and indi- vidual to such an extent that it may be isolated from other generically similar Phenomena. For example, in discussing footwear we can fairly easily separate\_the sneaker from the boot, the sandal, the thong, and several other types of shoes, on the basis of their distinctive qualities. In doing so we are consciously or\_unconsciously involved in one of the rudimentary procedures of style analysis.  As used in the arts, the term style refers to various levels, from the very general to the very particular. For instance, on a very general level one can ter to a Western style of music (as opposed to a non-Western style), or to Renaissance style (as-opposed to, say, a baroque style), or to an operatic style\_(as opposed to, say, a symphonic style). On a more particular level one can speak of a dixieland jazz style, as distinct from jazz style in general. On a\_still more particular level one can deal with the style of a given composer\_or even a specific composition...In this chapter we will deal specifically with the formation and develop- ment of Rock (n' Roll style, and also, more generally, with the formation of several other styles that have evolved in the course of Western music. We will be as concerned with the formative process of a style as we will with discovering and isolating its identifying characteristics."

  Abstract: >-
    Analyzes the rhythmic components in John Lee Hooker's boogie. Hooker recasts
    a signature riff from a ternary to a binary beat subdivision, paving the way
    for the triple-to-duple shift that characterized mid-century American
    popular music. Further, the boogie's hypnotic feel is attributed to two
    psychoacoustic phenomena: stream segregation and temporal order misjudgment.
    Stream segregation occurs when the musical surface is divided by the
    listener into two or more auditory entities (streams), usually as a result
    of timbral and registral contrasts. In Hooker's case, these contrasts occur
    between the guitar groove's downbeats and upbeats, whose extreme proximity
    also blurs their temporal order. These expressive effects are complemented
    by global and gradual accelerandos that envelop Hooker's early performances.

  Abstract: >-
    William O. Smith's contributions to the musical landscape of the 20th
    century are immense. As a composer, he has been the recipient of several
    prestigious awards, including: a Guggenheim Fellowship, Prix de Paris, Prix
    de Rome, and Phelan Award. His development of a card catalogue of
    multiphonics for the clarinet in 1960 was revolutionary, and profoundly
    influenced many composers such as Gunther Schuller, John Eaton, and Eric
    Mandat; who have all dedicated works to Smith. As a jazz artist, his
    recordings with Dave Brubeck (and other prominent jazz artists) were also
    innovative, and showcase some of the first Third Stream compositions (along
    with remarkable jazz clarinet performances). This research project traces
    his life through each important phase of his career (in both composition and
    performance). Each section includes reviews, correspondence, and interviews
    that highlight his professional accomplishments during that period. The main
    areas of focus are: his early studies with Milhaud and Sessions (and his
    polytonal approach to composition), membership in the Dave Brubeck Octet
    (and continuing relationship with Dave Brubeck), shift to serial techniques
    (during his time at the American Academy in Rome), invention and
    documentation of multiphonics for the clarinet, work with the American Jazz
    Ensemble, the double and demi-clarinet, polytempo concepts, aspects of
    theater in composition, minimalism, electronics, and the combination of jazz
    and classical idioms. A complete list of his compositions and a discography
    are included in the appendices.

  Abstract: >-
    The music of John Coltrane's Classic Quartet occupies a unique space in jazz
    history because it is at once comprised of complex harmonic and rhythmic
    structures that represent an advance in a style of music and also because of
    its consummate ability to capture the imaginations of its listeners beyond
    the culture and time period within which it was created. While the music
    remains relevant, it is Coltrane's life and his music's  history  rather
    than the music itself that have received the greatest level of attention.
    Consequently, the music, the initial inspiration, is only infrequently
    treated with a level of analytical rigor that it merits.                 Few
    scholarly works consider Coltrane's Classic Quartet, and still fewer analyze
    two of the music's most important features: interaction and rhythm.
    Furthermore, most studies analyze Coltrane's solos apart from the
    interactive context within which they take shape. Alternatively, the
    dissertation focuses on the music of the Classic Quartet and analyzes the
    solos  and  accompaniments, as well as interactions between the two. Its
    principal aim is to examine the harmonic and rhythmic
    structures.                 In contrast to analytical models indebted to a
    view of form from the analysis of Classical Music and written out
    compositions ("works") that privileges motivic connections and other symbols
    of unity, the dissertation argues that to be consistent both with the
    perspectives of those who create the music and with aesthetic principles of
    improvisation, a conception of form must account for the "processual,"  in
    time , interactions between what is performed (the musical surface) and
    predetermined substructures, which are not necessarily articulated. Original
    transcriptions demonstrate how the members of the Quartet create a rhetoric
    of tension and release by implying rhythmic structures and harmonic
    progressions that correspond to or oppose conventional rhythmic and harmonic
    substructures. Transcriptions of pre-Coltrane jazz also reveal a historical
    precedent for this aesthetic framework. Additionally, the dissertation
    examines original transcriptions of the Quartet's drummer, Elvin Jones, in
    order to explore the complex layers of implied rhythmic structures. The
    dissertation's transcriptional analysis that considers interaction and
    conventions provides a new perspective on, and appreciation for, the Classic
    Quartet.

  Abstract: >-
    Part I contrasted the conventional idea of regarding each important artist
    as a 'star'' vs. that of understanding his contribution in terms of the
    social and aesthetic environment out of which it has emerged. With respect
    to the latter approach, it was suggested that the development of any
    artist's style reflects not only the "vertical" influences between
    successive artistic generations (e.g .. Louis Armstrong/Roy Eldridge/Dizzy
    Gillespie), but also the more often overlooked "horizontal" influences
    between musicians who play together on a regular basis (e.g., Elvin
    Jones/McCoy Tyner/John Coltrane). As a prelude to examining the mutual
    influence exerted on each other by Elvin Jones and John Coltrane, the
    evolution of jazz rhythmic concepts to 1960 was summarized. Some
    illustrations of the riff, as a rhythmic device characteristic of the swing
    period, were provided; and the development of an asymmetric, discontinuous
    mode of handling rhythm by those bebop artists who overthrew the "four equal
    beats" characteristic of swing was also discussed. It was stated, without
    any attempt at demonstration, that the music of the John Coltrane group
    during the period 1960-1966 preserved all the most valuable features of the
    preceding periods while discarding those whose utility had been worn
    threadbare. Part II discussed Jones's contributions to the development of
    innovations which revolutionized jazz during the 1960s. With musical
    examples, it described the concept of rhythmic displacement, an approach
    which enabled Jones to come "as close to African polyrhythmic concepts as is
    possible within a jazz setting." It said of Jones: "in his ability to
    generate music tension and interest through a neverending manipulation of
    accents, he has no peer."

  Abstract: >-
    In critical writing on the music of Dave Brubeck, little attention has  been
    paid to the use of polyrhythm, despite the fact that this has been  central
    to Brubeck's approach to jazz since the late 1940s. Focusing on  work
    recorded by the â€˜classic' Dave Brubeck Quartet, the article aims to 
    re-evaluate Brubeck's use of polyrhythm by situating it within a  cultural
    history of modernity, rather than the established discourses of  jazz
    musicology. The article revisits the early 1960s to reconstruct  the context
    provided for the music not only by articles printed in the  music press, but
    also by news stories and features run in the popular  press, and by the
    visual signifiers that coalesce around Brubeck.  Articulated through the key
    tropes of modernity and difference, the  press's construction of Brubeck
    during this period signals the broad  cultural context of Modernism as an
    alternative frame within which his  musical practice might be usefully
    situated. The article explores how  two key cultural artefacts emerging from
    this context - Brubeck's  Oakland home, and the MirÃ_ canvas featured on the
    cover of the album Time  Further Out - might serve to provide a productive
    means by which  to re-evaluate the radical potential of Brubeck's
    polyrhythm.

  Abstract: >-
    The 1990s saw an explosion of various alternative music subgenres, among
    them 'math rock', which has been defined by its stylistic complexity and
    abstraction. Despite its alternative lineage, math rock aligns itself with
    the musical practices of progressive rock and heavy metal, often featuring
    multi-sectional forms and powerful guitar riffs. Focusing on the math rock
    band Don Caballero, an extended analysis of their song 'Stupid puma' is
    undertaken. Attention is focused on the implied symbolic connections between
    math rock and mathematics, and the reception of math rock as a cultural
    phenomenon.

    English: The music of the Swedish metal band Meshuggah reveals a distinct
    rhythmic and metric structure based on large-scale odd time signatures,
    mixed meter, and metric superimposition. Their 2004 EP I, however, pushes
    the boundaries of surface-level meter through the absence of small-scale
    recurring units of pitch and rhythm. Models are used for rhythmic analysis
    developed by Harald Krebs, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, William
    Rothstein, and Maury Yeston in pursuing an architectonic examination of
    hierarchical layers in this music. Additionally, an important relationship
    exists between fans and structural analysis based on a socio-cultural
    profile of the subgenre. Abstractor: author

  Abstract: >-
    Scat singing, the usual medium for jazz vocal improvisation, is usually
    understood as singers imitating instrumentalists. By dissociating the vocal
    line from verbal meaning, scat singers venture into the realm of so-called
    "absolute" music, where musical sounds are free of the extra-musical
    associations that words create. An analytic approach to scat that grows from
    the distinctive features of jazz vocal performance practice is illustrated
    with a focus on timbre. Using phonetic symbols, the wide palette of vocal
    timbres available to scat singers can be notated and the ways in which these
    singers employ their sonic raw materials can be examined.

    The following investigation posits an essential relationship between  the
    spontaneous compositions of John Coltrane's late period, his  musical
    evolution from his formative years to the end of his career,  his spiritual
    development, and the socioculture in which he lived and  created. Because of
    this interdependence, I also propose that racism  in American society had a
    significant negative impact upon the music  of this African-American
    composer and his musical colleagues in  numerous ways.

  Abstract: >-
    Math rock’s most salient compositional facet is its cyclical repetition of
    grooves featuring changing and odd-cardinality meter. These unconventional
    grooves deform the conventional rhythmic structures of rock, such as
    backbeat and steady pulse, in such a way that a listener’s sense of metric
    organization is initially thwarted. Using transcriptions from math-rock
    artists such as Radiohead, The Mars Volta, and The Chariot, the author
    demonstrates a new analytical apparatus aimed at making sense of the ways
    listeners and performers process these changing pulse levels: the pivot
    pulse. The pivot pulse is defined as the slowest temporal level preserved in
    a given meter change. The author suggests that the preservation or
    disruption of the primary pulse level (that is, the temporal level at which
    a listener’s or performer’s primary kinesthetic involvement happens, such as
    dancing or foot-tapping) is of paramount importance. For example, a change
    from 4/4 to 3/4, which preserves the quarter-note pulse, will be less
    disruptive to a listener’s metric entrainment than a change from 4/4 to 7/8
    or 7/8 to 15/16, both of which split the primary pulse in half. In order to
    formalize pivot-pulse methodology, the author presents an algebraic model
    based on the commutative operations greatest common denominator and lowest
    common multiple. Pivot-pulse methodology is also applied metaphorically to
    the kinesthetic interpretations of performers and listeners to better
    understand the complex movements incited by math-rock grooves.

  Abstract: "Since the dawn of experimental rock's second coming in the new millennium, experimental artists have begun distancing themselves from Top-40 artists through formal structures that eschew recapitulatory verse/chorus conventions altogether. In order to understand the correlation between genre and form more thoroughly, this paper provides a taxonomic approach to through-composition in several post-millennial experimental rock genres including post-rock, math-metal, art rock, and neo-prog. Combining the presence or absence of two salient formal parameters (hierarchical grouping structure and thematic unification) generates four possible through-composed archetypes. Representative examples from the post-millennial rock corpus are provided for each archetype, and accompanying analyses identify the specific musical elements that engender such formal divisions. Included interviews suggest that this taxonomic model is congruent with the language musicians use to describe their own compositional strategies. Throughout the article, a case is made for the substantive link between specific types of through-composed forms and the genres in which those forms regularly appear, as well as for the difference between formal designs found in post-millennial experimental rock and those found in conventional rock music.\_"

  Abstract: "Suggests a way to analyze and interpret\_jazz\_solos recorded between 1920 and 1950, and argues that improvised solos by black Americans have much to do with musical syntax characteristic of West\_African\_music. European harmonic practices were incorporated into this\_African-derived syntactical model. The model suggests a way to account for both similarities and differences within the tradition, e.g., the way in which bebop is an intensification of the model perfected by Armstrong. Music from the southern Ewe people of Ghana is analyzed, as are solos by Armstrong, Young, and Hawkins."

  Abstract: >-
    The Chicago sound is situated as a little-known but remarkably coherent site
    of stylistic synthesis and productivity. An examination of its local
    development focuses on the activities of Steve Albini, the Chicago-based
    musician and engineer who is commonly singled out as the progenitor of the
    Chicago sound. Albini's rhetoric, workingman persona, and immediately
    recognizable recording strategies have become trademarks of the style. The
    musical surface and recording strategies of several songs are analyzed in an
    attempt to show how the choices made by Chicago-sound bands reflect the
    projection of a marked identity. The ways in which the primary elements of
    this style are adopted and transformed by subsequent bands in a continual
    motion away from geographic or stylistic fixity as the Chicago sound becomes
    part of the global language of underground rock practice are explored.

  Abstract: >-
    Three salient features define Fela Sowande's music as a composer of concert
    music and a jazz performer: (1) many of his works are based on folk songs,
    (2) his work as a performer was typified by a sustained collaboration with
    black musicians, and (3) his arrangements of Negro spirituals and his
    interaction with black musicians from the diaspora illustrate his
    fascination for incorporating musical materials from different cultures into
    his compositions. Sowande was motivated by a desire to promote encounter and
    dialogue and to reinforce a sense of common identity among black populations
    from different parts of the world. The significance of Negro spirituals in
    Sowande's works is revealed in the fact that they account for close to 25
    percent of his compositional output.

  'Style,Tertiary': Drum & bass
  Abstract: >-
    Electronic Dance Music (EDM), a musical genre left relatively unexplored in
    music theory offers music theorists numerous exciting opportunities for
    analytical inquiry. This paper focuses on the rhythms and formal structures
    encountered in three distinct sub-genres of EDM: Drum and Bass/Jungle,
    Trip-Hop, and Intelligent. Works by Diesel Boy, DJ Dara, DJ Shadow, Goldie,
    Plaid, and Squarepusher are considered throughout.   Rhythms are analyzed
    using Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff's writings on listener intuition,
    grouping structure, meter, and tactus, Gretchen Horlacher's writings on
    cycles and hierarchical structures, and John Roeder's writings on pulse
    streams. Also considered are ideas put forth in the writings of Harald Krebs
    and more recently, Mark Butler. The paper combines all of the above
    approaches in an attempt to analyze not only the metrically consonant
    structures that pervade most of EDM, but also the metrically dissonant
    structures such as those created through the use of displacement dissonance
    and the layering of out of phase strata.   The rhythmic structures of EDM
    expand outward to create large-scale form. Traditional forms such as
    Passacaglia and even Sonata form are sometimes evoked in this music. While
    the intentions of the composers on producing these forms is doubtful,
    analyzing the works as such gives us a unique perspective on what is
    happening in the music. Tracing the form produced throughout entire tracks
    of EDM shows us how these forms are still being adapted today.

  Abstract: >-
    F. Scott Fitzgerald's use of elements of jazz music in his book "The Great
    Gatsby" is examined. Fitzgerald knew enough about jazz musical structures to
    incorporate their elements into the novel, which is one of the best literary
    pictures of the jazz age. In jazz, Fitzgerald had found a truly American
    music with built-in tensions and conflicts that mirrored the theme of the
    American Dream in his novel. By adapting syncopation and polyrhythms, swing,
    improvisation, variation, and tonal color to the form of the novel, he
    insisted that the underlying dissonance and conflict in American society
    make the achievement of the American Dream an impossible goal. Jazz music
    became the musical expression of these themes in "The Great Gatsby." A list
    of works cited is included.

  Abstract: >-
    Piet Mondrian's interest in popular music and dance began in the teens, when
    the ragtime craze reached his native Holland. He continued to collect jazz
    records and frequent dance and concert halls in Paris in the 1920s and
    1930s, attending performances by Josephine Baker and Louis Armstrong. Close
    reading of his essays combined with formal analysis of his paintings reveals
    that Mondrian took jazz rhythms and dance steps as vehicles for thinking
    about pictorial composition. His theory and practice of visual rhythm
    advanced, like jazz itself, from the marked syncopations of ragtime to the
    looser polyrhythms of classic jazz and finally boogie-woogie piano music.

  Abstract: >-
    In accompanying improvising soloists, jazz drummers must both maintain a
    steady pulse in conjunction with the bassist and generate intensity and
    excitement by means of irregular, improvised accompaniment patterns known as
    comping. Timekeeping and comping practices are generally conceived in
    opposition, with the former understood as solid and the latter as liquid.
    This essay shows how one modern jazz drummer employs variants of common
    timekeeping patterns in a more liquid way to generate motional energy
    through the strategic production of metric dissonance at key moments within
    a performance. In this way, timekeeping patterns may be understood not as
    extraneous to rhythmic intensification, but as integral to it.

  Abstract: >-
    A theory is presented regarding the use of swing rhythm patterns in jazz
    music. The author examines the expressive function of the swing eighth note,
    suggesting that swing is a less specifiable rhythmic essence than an active
    rhythmic process involving the skillful management of "motional" energy
    within a performance.

    The article presents the static harmony approach of musician Wes Montgomery.
    It states that Montgomery can switch notes in a subtle way by changing
    single-note lines to harmonic and rhythmic approaches. It notes that he
    excels in rhythmic variation of creating polyrhythms which maintains a
    terrific sound. It adds that in his solo progression in "Full House," he
    accented every two beats which created an ear-catching phrase. Moreover,
    chord examples of his accented beats are also presented.

  Abstract: >-
    Jazz saxophonist Peter Apfelbaum is profiled. Apfelbaum has thrived on the
    East Coast through his strong connections from the West Coast. Many of his
    collaborations stem from his encounters in the Berkeley, California, public
    school system in the 1970s. Those California relationships are heard
    throughout "It Is Written" (ACT), Apfelbaum's first new release in almost a
    decade. Marked by contrasting passages and rapid shifts, the music is a mix
    of seemingly simple melodic lines on top of complex harmonic movement and
    interlocking polyrhythms.

    Verläufen, während unimetrische Verläufe auÃŸer acht gelassen werden. Die
    Analyse zeigt, daÃŸ diese metrischen Prozesse von weitgehender Freiheit
    bestimmt sind, sich jedoch im Rahmen eines harmonisch-metrischen
    Grundschemas, des Chorus, halten. Marsalis' Konzept metrischer Improvisation
    folgt nicht konventionellen Mustern und ist in hohem MaÃŸe originell.

  Abstract: >-
    In the 1970s young Finnish musicians were interested in blending folk
    musical traditions with jazz and light music, as exemplified in the music of
    Seppo Paakkunainen, Sakari Kukko, and Edward Vesala, who founded the popular
    music group known as the Karelia in 1970. In exploring elements of Finnish
    folk music, such as polyrhythm, improvisation, repetition, and certain tonal
    characteristics, the musicians saw parallels between these elements and
    those of jazz. They experimented with both old and innovative musical
    instruments, and gained familiarity with non-Finnish musical traditions
    through international travel, films, and commercial recordings.

  Abstract: >-
    Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, who passed away in 2012, was one of the most
    influential jazz musicians of all time, and his fascination with odd time
    signatures is evidenced in much of his music. He was also exposed to
    classical music during his formative music education years. Here, several of
    Brubeck's signature devices - blues, stride, odd time signatures,
    polyrhythms and polytonality - are briefly explained and illustrated.

  Abstract: >-
    Dizzy Gillespie has secured his place in the jazz pantheon as one of the
    most expressive and virtuosic improvisers in the history of music. As one of
    the primary creators of the bebop and Afro-Cuban revolutions, he twice
    fundamentally changed the way jazz improvisation was done. Later he extended
    his revolutionary reach by transforming the aesthetic of big band jazz.
    Gillespie's saga is chronicled as he moved from the lowest rung on the
    American social and political ladder to the highest. Born in fiercely racist
    Cheraw, South Carolina, in 1917, Dizzy climbed out of rural poverty to a
    role among the Swing Era jazz elite before his 21st birthday. With bebop
    during the late 1930s and early 1940s, Dizzy and four colleagues-Charlie
    Parker, Kenny Clarke, Thelonious Monk, and Charlie Christian-radically
    expanded the rhythmic and harmonic foundations of jazz. Subsequently, Dizzy
    and Mario Bauzá recast the music during the late 1940s by enriching it with
    Afro-Cuban polyrhythms. The trumpeter and his colleagues endured a torrent
    of criticism before their innovations were accepted into the mainstream.
    These criticisms were undercut by Gillespie's noted warmth and comedic
    skills, becoming beloved worldwide and achieving a popularity that few
    modern jazz musicians have ever enjoyed.

  Abstract: >-
    Historical aspects of the Cubop or Afro-Cuban Jazz movement are discussed
    with an emphasis on the style's innovators and founders such as Mario Bauzá,
    Dizzy Gillespie, Francisco Grillo (Machito), and Chano Pozo.  The timeline
    traces events beginning in 1930s and 40s with the formation of Machito's
    band the Afro-Cubans, which Bauzá joined in 1941.  Gillespie's pioneering of
    bebop led him to conga player/composer/dancer Pozo, and the two joined up
    with Bauzá and Machito in the late 1940s.  The structural changes in jazz
    and the effects of these changes are discussed through a careful study of
    Gillespie's innovation of African polyrhythms evident on his various
    recordings and performances such as "Mantecca" and "Cubana Be, Cubana Bop." 
    Other details trace the band's European tour of 1948, when they encountered
    a North Atlantic storm delaying their arrival, suffered with financial
    challenges and underminings after arrival, and the success and hysteria
    brought on by European audiences.  A follow-up tour in America is also
    briefly discussed when the famous Royal Roost jazz venue was founded.

  Abstract: >-
    The division between high-art electronic music and pop electronic music is
    best defined in terms of rhythmic content. Pop electronic music uses
    repetitive beats, primarily in 4/4 time, but a new generation of composers
    is working within that structure to create what is essentially the new art
    music. This phenomenon is an outgrowth of such historical currents as
    minimalism and postmodernism, along with the continuing development of a
    global technoculture; it is part of a larger cultural shift in which art is
    becoming more connected with society rather than being created by and for
    specialists. This positive development is being accelerated by the rapid
    evolution of new technologies for producing and reproducing music today, as
    well as by new possibilities for distribution and dissemination of music
    electronically.

    The article discusses the concepts of syncopation and polyrhythms in blues
    drumming. The author tackles first the basics of blues drumming which
    involves counting using an 8th-note-triplet subdivision. Musical notations
    are provided to illustrate some examples of patterns reflecting syncopation
    and polyrhythms. The author also offers recommendations to properly perform
    blues drumming and describes a variation that uses the standard jazz ride.

    The recording of metal band Mastodon's fourth album is discussed. The
    as-yet-titled recording is produced by Brendon O'Brien and contains music
    inspired by Mastodon's Brent Hinds' violent altercation following the MTV
    Video Music Awards in September 2007, which resulted in the
    guitarist/vocalist suffering a serious brain injury. The album, under
    O'Brien's production, is due out in early 2009, and will contain only seven
    songs that lean more toward a classic-rock sound than previous Mastodon
    releases.

    ostinatos and polyrhythms to create independence. An ostinato is defined as
    a repeating pattern that is played with one or more limbs. Several drumming
    patterns that involve playing multiple ostinatos across the kit with all
    four limbs are presented.

  Abstract: >-
    That backward style. That is how musicians often refer to Eli "Lucky" 
    Thompson's playing. His phrasing is the opposite of what one might expect, 
    they say. His accents fall in the "wrong" places, on the "wrong" beats,  in
    the "wrong" order. As they speak, their tone mixes awe with irony. Irony, 
    that is, because his style seems to counter the hip way of phrasing they 
    worked so hard to cultivate. And awe, because he pulls it off.  Thompson, an
    eccentric even to admirers, a marginal figure in histories of  jazz, is a
    master of the tenor and soprano saxophones. (Though still alive at  this
    writing, Thompson has unfortunately not been active for almost 30 years.) 
    His career bridged the worlds of the canonical Charlie Parker and John 
    Coltrane, and he often stood at the cutting edge with both. Thompson's
    distinctive  rhythmic approach actually grew from and advanced a significant
    jazz  tradition. Bringing that context back in will help make sense of his
    "backward"  style and show how forward looking it really was. Focusing in
    particular  on his deft use of phrasing tools such as accents, articulation,
    and timing  can yield some valuable insights on the role they play in jazz
    improvisation.

  Abstract: >-
    While the popular genres of progressive rock and heavy metal have received
    significant scholarly attention, discussions of the syncretic subgenre of
    progressive metal are rare. Jonathan Pieslak's 2007 article on the music of
    Meshuggah does much to delimit the stylistic boundaries of the subgenre,
    noting the importance placed by progressive metal bands and their fans on
    the rhythmic and metrical complexity of the music. Dream Theater, one of the
    most visible and commercially successful progressive metal bands, however,
    has received little scholarly attention to this point. The aim of this
    article is to describe Dream Theater's unique metrical processes, focusing
    on a technique that I label the ABAC Additive Metrical Process (ABAC-AMP).
    The temporally complex examples I analyze in this article, culled from
    throughout Dream Theater's decades-long career, are compared with techniques
    of early minimalist composers. The analysis demonstrates Dream Theater's
    "progressive" aesthetic, and it aids in a characterization of the band's
    sound as possessing a progressive rock center and a heavy metal periphery.

  Abstract: >-
    This essay analyzes the temporal structure of recent jazz forms. While some
    Western musics tend to be directional and show a development, non-Western
    musics are charactreized by an alternative aesthetic of music as a
    sound-state without clear beginning or end. While the time concept of
    earlier jazz differs from most African musics, African roots have been
    reintegrated into jazz since the late Fifties. The most important temporal
    structure in recent hazz is polymeter, that is, the simlataneous
    realizatiion of two or more independent metrical laters. In contemporary
    African American music, however, musical time ostne conceived as ritualistic
    and sacred time.

  Abstract: >-
    To say that jazz is metrically complex is, at best, an understatement. At
    its core, jazz gains much of its vitality from the constant tension between
    strong and weak beats in any given passage. The backbone of jazz rhythm is
    syncopation-the placement of accented beats or rhythms in typically
    unaccented locations-and the interplay between multiple layers of both
    syncopated and unsyncopated rhythmic patterns. As a result, most jazz
    performances feature a variegated and complex rhythmic texture. While this
    rhythmic complexity is one of the most characteristic features of  jazz this
    aspect of jazz is often overlooked in jazz theory and analysis; most jazz
    theory tends to focus on pitch issues such as harmonic progression, voice
    leading, motivic development, and so on.   In our paper, we would like to
    examine this somewhat neglected parameter of jazz music by applying the
    ideas of metric consonance and dissonance, concepts first developed by music
    theorist Harald Krebs in his discussion of 19thcentury  music in general,
    and the music of Robert Schumann in particular. Time and space constraints
    prohibit us from taking an exhaustive look at the jazz literature from this
    analytical perspective, so we will focus our attention on selected musical
    examples of two well-known and, in their own ways, innovative jazz pianists:
    Thelonious Monk and James P. Johnson. That Monk's career post-dates
    Johnson's by some 20 years allows us to observe how Monk's approach to the
    instrument differs from and is similar to Johnson's, and to observe the
    implications that these similarities and differences  have on the overall
    metric consonance and dissonance of their respective music. We will conclude
    with an example by a young Mary Lou Williams that reveals the strong
    influence of Johnson on her playing style in general and on her approach to
    rhythm in particular.   Note: "Abstract" taken from intro text.

    An essay is presented that examines a variety of compositional procedures
    that give rise to what the author defines as "accumulative" and "cumulative"
    forms in pop-rock music, formal processes which are directly linked to the
    rapid advances in recording technology that occurred mainly from the late
    1960s to the 1980s. It includes detailed transcriptions and analyses of
    pop-rock music across a wide range of styles and genres, from progressive
    rock to post-punk to techno.

  Abstract: "Few scholars of rap music have analyzed rap as they would other forms of Western texted music, by examining the relationship of the music to the text. This article will suggest that this type of analysis of rap is possible, but will argue that since the music in rap is composed before the text is written, we must change our analytical focus to examine not how the music supports the text, but how the text supports the music. I will propose a new analytical method for rap, and use excerpts from A Tribe Called Quest, OutKast, and artists affiliated with them, to show how rappers incorporate rhythms, groupings, and motives from the underlying music into the rhythm of the lyrics.  \_  "

  Abstract: "This article systematically explores the concept of flow in rap music, with the goal of understanding how rappers' uses of flow contribute both to the surface rhythmic vitality of a song and to deeper levels of musical meaning. I will explain the three most significant metrical techniques that constitute a rapper's flow, and give examples of rap songs using each technique. The article concludes with some thoughts on how changes in flow as rap music evolved contributed not only to different style features, but also to value judgments by both rappers and audiences.\_"

    Analysis of 200 themes shows that these constitute a highly stylized body of
    melody in which there is a distinct preference for certain rhythmic patterns
    over others and a high degree of association between specific rhythmic
    patterns and pitch contours. Melodic structure in the larger dimensions can
    usually be explained in terms of the various archetypal schemata, which
    Leonard B. Meyer and Eugene Narmour have traced through the tonal repertoire
    of Western art music.

  Abstract: >-
    Ragtime music incorporated characteristics from Africa (polyrhythms and
    pentatonic melodies, frequently accompanied on the banjo) and from Europe
    (the major-minor harmonic system, and the rhythms, meters, and formal
    structures of 19th-c. social dances and marches). In turn European and
    American composers, intrigued by ragtime's syncopation, adapted its traits
    to their own compositions. The author discusses 45 ragtime-related works by
    the following composers: Albright, Auric, Bacon, Berlin, Carpenter, Copland,
    Debussy, Gould, Gruenberg, Hindemith, Ives, Krenek, Lecouna, Lemont,
    Milhaud, Poulenc, Powell, Prokof'ev, Satie, Stravinsky, Tansman, Thomson,
    Walton, and Weill.

  Abstract: "The earliest instrumental jazz (1917-23) shares the following traits with West African music (20th-c. folk): improvisation (collective aspects, in particular); syncopation (especially that which results from polyrhythms); call-and- response style; percussive use of instruments; use of banjolike instruments, woodblock, and cowbells; emphasis on percussion instruments; steady tempo; alteration of instrument sounds to produce roughenings, buzzes, and ringings; cultivation of assorted attacks for decorating the onsets of tones; pitch changes to decorate the decays of tones; blue notes; a tendency for pieces in major\_keys to sound as though they are minor; extensive use of short-pattern repetition; and informal performance atmosphere.

    In excerpts from an interview conducted on 22 July 1972, the author and the

    values and his setting of Langston Hughes's poem Joy. In a musical analysis
    of the song, Swanson discusses its blues and jazz influences: the handling
    of polyrhythms and the inspirations for some of the motives. The work of
    current black composers draws less on the oral tradition of black music than
    did the work of earlier generations. (J.D.S. Armstrong)

    of metric dissonance in the works of single artists and bands as well as in
    a cross-section of rock songs. These data allow for comparative analyses of
    the metric profile of a given artist or band, suggest genre correlations
    with particular metric patterns, and demonstrate a trend of increasing
    metric dissonance throughout the history of rock.

  Abstract: >-
    Analyses of jazz solos often focus on the superimposition of complex
    harmonies on the fabric of simple harmonic progressions and highly
    embellished melodies. With respect to rhythm, it is the juxtaposition of
    implied meter and polyrhythm that is tantamount to the harmonic and melodic
    superimposition. The enslavement of jazz into simple, yet highly organized,
    forms is just the broad template, a starting point which allows not only
    numerous harmonic and melodic implications, but even more significantly, the
    juxtaposition of temporal spaces and complex polyrhythm, superimposition of
    implied meter, and complex inflections. This essay traces how these
    important aspects of rhythm in jazz emerged from early examples and shows
    how simple two-dimensional occurrences of implied meter were translated into
    complex three-dimensional polyrhythmic organizations as observed in the
    drumming John Coltrane's percussionist Elvin Jones.

  Abstract: >-
    The complexity of rap music, like many Afro-diasporic musics, is found in
    rhythmic and percussive density and organization. The role of repetition and
    variation in rap music is examined in terms of repetition's African
    diasporic significance, and in terms of repetition as a cultural force in
    the age of mass reproduction. The writings of James A. Snead and Jacques
    Attali are brought to bear on the subject.

  Abstract: >-
    This study investigates jazz pianist and composer Herbie Hancock's seven
    albums recorded as a bandleader for Blue Note Records between 1962 and 1969.
    Recorded during Hancock's tenures with Donald Byrd and Miles Davis, his
    early works are highly mature musical conceptions, with all the major
    elements of Hancock's personal musical style already
    present.                 A mixed-methods approach combining several forms of
    qualitative data analyses is used to identify the formal construction, the
    musical meanings, and the cultural significance of this body of music. The
    study surveys the thirty-six compositions that comprise these seven albums,
    and selects for in-depth analysis seven pieces that are proportionally
    representative of the formal characteristics of this larger repertoire: "The
    Maze," "The Pleasure Is Mine," "Jack Rabbit," "One Finger Snap," "Little
    One," "Toys," and "I Have A Dream."                 Hancock's improvisations
    on these representative compositions are transcribed, and each improvisation
    and composition is analyzed for its historical, aesthetic, and formal
    properties. The cultural and historical context and significance of each
    recording is examined through interviews with persons involved in the
    original recording process, as well as other jazz musicians and scholars
    with deep knowledge of Hancock's life, music and oeuvre. Aesthetic analyses,
    informed by the theories of Kivy and Elliott, investigate the expressive or
    representational qualities of each composition, and examine how formal
    musical elements contribute to these expressive or representational
    qualities. Formal analyses examine elements of harmony, rhythm, and melody
    characteristic of Hancock's compositional and improvisational
    style.                 The study concludes that Hancock's compositions and
    improvisations of this period exhibit a number of consistent style elements,
    such as sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic superimposition, that were an
    important influence on jazz pianists of the following generation. Two major
    stylistic shifts are also identified in the repertoire, as Hancock
    increasingly introduces first indeterminacy and then counterpoint into his
    compositions and improvisations.

  Abstract: >-
    Troy Roberts is a jazz saxophonist originally from Perth, West Australia. At
    present, no academic research has been done on Roberts’ compositions or
    playing, making this research project a positive way of contributing new
    information to the academic body of knowledge. His album The XenDen suite
    was chosen as the material best suited to provide insight into his
    musicianship (particularly focusing on his compositional and arranging
    techniques), as it is both intellectually complex and also musically
    innovative. The aim of the study was to identify and describe the use of
    various techniques and devices (including their relevance, purpose and
    function) present in Roberts’ music. Through this study, this researcher
    attempted to gain a basic overview of Roberts’ musical characteristics, with
    the objective to be able to utilize this information to further this
    researcher’s musical development (including compositions, arrangements and
    saxophone playing). The findings were useful for direct application (that
    is, the techniques could be used in the same manner as they appeared in the
    XenDen suite, and could therefore be immediately applied to other areas such
    as composition, arrangement and improvisation), but the many different ways
    in which the techniques were used compositionally by Roberts provided a more
    insightful look into broader musical concepts, and their application.

  Abstract: >-
    The stylized delivery of the words in relation to the beat, the 'flow,'
    makes rapping a musical experience even when the words are not understood
    (Kyle Adams, 2008/2009). This study analyzes the musical attributes of rap
    delivery. A theory is proposed that rhyme functions like motivic parallelism
    to embed a separate "higher-level" perceptual stream in the monophonic
    delivery. Thus rappers use rhyme and other prosodic features to create a
    multileveled rhythmic structure, akin to the 'implied polyphony' found in
    some monophonic melodic works (Stacy Davis, 2006/2011). It is argued that
    rap flow is structured so as to create expectations on multiple levels,
    which are alternatively fulfilled or thwarted to create a balance of tension
    and release analogous to that described in traditional music theories of
    melody and harmony. An empirical study is conducted which tests the validity
    of the theory by measuring the predictability of rap delivery using
    techniques from information theory. The entropy of the metric placement of
    the "higher" stream of rhyming syllables is shown to be modulated by rappers
    in order to give flow a balance of predictability and surprise. A corpus
    analysis of popular rap works reveals that the overall entropy in popular
    rap has increased over the genre's history, from the relatively predictable
    rhymes of "old-school" rap into the more complex flows of the 1990s
    new-school. This increase in rhythmic entropy reinforces the previously
    established increase in the complexity and volume of rhyme over the same
    period (Hussein Hirjee & Daniel Brown, 2010).

  Abstract: >-
    The question of how listeners infer a metric hierarchy from a musical
    surface has

    attracted much attention. Though listeners seem. to agree on a metric
    interpretation

    in most cases, theorists have noted numerous pieces where the "correct"
    metric interpretation

    is (at least initially) ambiguous. Justin London refers to metrically
    misleading

    introductions in Rock music as metric "fake-outs." Metric fake-outs occur

    when metric cues are closely balanced or conflicting. Thus, in addition to
    being an

    interesting device in their own right, fake-outs offer a valuable inroad to
    studying

    metric cues in general.

    Participants listened to a variety of pieces known to evoke fake-outs and
    counted

    along in the manner that seemed most natural to them. Results confirm that
    fakeouts

    do happen to typical musicians, but that they are highly inconsistent: Some

    listeners hear extremely syncopated passages correctly the first time while
    others are

    never able to do so. The most common error seems to occur when an anacrusis
    is

    misinterpreted as a down beat. To explore this issue, recomposed excerpts
    were created

    where pick-ups were removed. Results indicate that the tendency to infer the

    first heard note as a down beat is extremely powerful.

    In a related study, newly composed rhythm excerpts were designed to test the
    influence

    of the effect of metric interpretation on the qualia or "feel" of a rhythm.
    The

    same rhythm evokes different qualia depending on metric interpretation.

  Abstract: >-
    English: Syncopation in rock is analyzed using cognitive music theory,
    bringing together music theory and psychology and concerned with the
    experienced listener, someone who is familiar with a musical genre through
    exposure but not formally trained. It is hypothesized that syncopation in
    rock works in a fundamentally different way than in classical music. In
    classical music, accents are often placed on weak beats. In rock, accents
    are actively displaced from one beat to another, and listeners understand
    certain stresses as belonging on beats other than the ones on which they
    fall. A way of formalizing this rule is proposed using the framework of Fred
    Lerdahl's and Ray Jackendoff's A generative theory of tonal musicand their
    theory of meter. Instances of syncopation are analyzed in recordings by the
    Beatles, Marvin Gaye's I heard it through the grapevine, Pearl Jam's
    Daughter, Fleetwood Mac's Go your own way, and Spin Doctor's Two princes.

  Abstract: >-
    This study focuses on rhythmic patterns in funk music that are neither
    entirely “consonant”

    nor “dissonant” with regard to the underlying meter. It begins by defining
    such “pulse-neutral”

    (PN) rhythms as patterns that split their allegiance between a prevailing
    meter and a displaced

    version thereof. To fit this definition within the context of existing
    theories of rhythm and

    meter, this study uses beat-class theory to demonstrate how such rhythms can
    be formed by

    transposition (time-shifting), by inversion, through the combination of
    metrically dissonant

    and consonant pulses, or by a generating interval. It then shows how PN
    rhythms arise in

    funk music, a genre that only very recently has begun to receive significant
    music-analytic

    attention. Included in this study is analysis of brief passages of funk
    music by artists such as

    Parliament, Rufus, and James Brown, as well as excerpts of “linear funk,” an
    essentially monophonic

    style of drumming pioneered by players such as Mike Clark (Herbie Hancock),
    David

    Garibaldi (Tower of Power), and Steve Gadd (Paul Simon, Chick Corea). The
    study suggests

    that with respect to funk music, inversional symmetry is an important
    generative aspect of PN

    rhythms, since this symmetry characterizes rudiments from which funk
    drumming is built. It

    concludes by outlining some connections between the PN property and more
    general ideas

    about rhythm in funk music discourse.

  Abstract: >-
    The spiritual economy of rap is found primarily in its music, not its
    lyrics. It conjures the spirit be evoking what Claude Lévi-Strauss calls
    'musical emotion', which derives from the composer's or musician's play with
    the listener's expectations; its effect is also temporal and spatial. The
    principal musical effect of African and Afro-diasporic music is based in its
    complex polyrhythm. An analysis of Wyclef Jean's song Diallo shows how the
    music intersects three spiritual domains: liberatory (seeking freedom from
    oppression), liminal (bringing one to the threshold of liberation), and
    integrative (striving toward a unified community).

  Abstract: >-
    With a sound once compared to an “army of glam-rock robots gargling sheet
    metal,”1 the

    contemporary, New York City-based band Battles combines the visceral energy
    and timbres of

    indie rock with the repetitive, loop-based rhythmic structures of electronic
    dance music (EDM).

    Like EDM, metrical dissonance—the sounding of metrically conflicting
    rhythms—is pervasive,

    though with a degree of rhythmic complexity and instrumental virtuosity more
    commonly found in

    progressive rock, especially the “math rock” subgenre that emerged in the
    late 1980s.

    In developing a methodology for studying metrical dissonance, theorists have
    focused

    primarily on classical music’s common-practice period, and generally ignored
    music from other

    genres—particularly un-notated genres in which metrical dissonance is a
    subjective experience,

    without visual cues such as time signatures and barlines. This paper uses
    terms and

    nomenclature developed by Harald Krebs to examine the ways metrical
    dissonance is created in

    Battles’ music and the role of the listener in determining metrical
    structure during moments of

    ambiguity. I will also draw on the work of Mark Butler, whose application of
    Krebs’ methods to

    EDM reveals processes of rhythmic layering and beat displacement similar to
    those used by

    Battles. Through the use of original transcriptions, I will argue that a
    listener’s metrical perception

    is guided largely by the drum pattern and hypermetric organization,
    including embedded

    hypermeasures in dissonant rhythmic layers. Five tracks serve as examples of
    metrical

    dissonance in Battles’ music: “DDiamondd,” “Rainbow,” “SZ2,” and “TRAS 2,”
    as well as “Tonto”

    in its studio, live, and remixed versions.

  Abstract: >-
    Thelonious Monk's composition "Criss Cross" has often been used to exemplify
    the use of motivic development in his compositions and improvisations. The
    author uses as source material his transcriptions of the four known recorded
    performances by Monk of "Criss Cross." These are used as concrete evidence
    that Monk was a soloist who often related his improvisations to the motives
    initially presented, and perhaps, in his capacity as bandleader, was
    attempting to create in performance a work unified from beginning to end by
    references to the thematic and formal structure of the composition.

  Abstract: >-
    The jazz band has become an important part of instrumental music programs in
    elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges throughout the country.
    Percussion ensembles are also growing in numbers and more literature for
    both types of groups has become available in recent years. New demands are
    placed upon the performer as well as the listener when interpreting music
    which no longer fits categorically into the classical or jazz style or into
    one traditional cultural context. Jazz composers and performers have long
    been influenced by African and Latin American rhythms. Composers of "new
    music" have cited a variety of influences including American jazz, European,
    black blues, gospel and most recently the east. An examination of available
    literature reveals relatively few ensemble works involving Afro-Jazz or
    Latin styles. Those that do are mainly short novelty pieces. Music educators
    have stated the importance of including contemporary music, jazz and
    improvisation in performance curriculums.                 Therefore, there
    is a need for an original composition which reflects the diversity of
    influences in the contemporary style. Schools need literature, to fill a gap
    in the repertoire, which does not demand exotic instruments or synthesized
    sounds and which is not too technically advanced or unique to be included in
    school programs. The Concerto for Percussion and Jazz Band was composed to
    help fill this need. A related paper includes a stylistic interpretive
    analysis as well as suggestions for teaching/rehearsing and
    performance.                 The difficulty of the composition is geared to
    the advanced high school or college level. Because of the limitations of
    available instruments in some institutions, alternatives are given for
    special parts. Most of the equipment is easily available from concert band,
    jazz band and percussion ensemble inventories. The presence of "prepared"
    percussion instruments allows for unusual effects without undue difficulty
    in obtaining instruments.                 The author has drawn upon
    experiences with percussion performance and teaching as resources in the
    creation of a three movement concerto in which sections of the band are
    treated with equal importance. Some sections feature soloists in the form of
    a solo concerto. Polyrhythms and multiple meters are applied to the ensemble
    as well as the individual multiple percussion instruments. Composing the
    piece was a culminating activity for the author which allowed for the
    synthesis of several diverse influences into one creative
    project.                 A demonstration tape and full score are included
    with the related paper. The composition expands the repertoire for high
    school and college groups and provides material for discussion and listening
    experiences in non-performing classes as well.

    English: Polyrhythm is approached through the findings of research on music
    perception, an interview with an African master drummer, and the process of
    transcribing improvised jazz solos by Thelonius Monk, Ornette Coleman, and
    Eric Dolphy. Polyrhythm is classified into three distinct types, drawing on
    previous work (particularly that of Maury Yeston) to formalize a measure of
    polyrhythmic dissonance. The analyses are combined with a discussion of
    underlying linear progressions and large-scale forms.

    The live recording of Body and soul by Dexter Gordon and his band at
    Keystone Korner in San Francisco on 16 September 1978 captures Gordon at the
    pinnacle of his creative genius. A transcription and analysis of the tenor
    solo, Rufus Reid's bass line, and the chord changes allows for a detailed
    study of the structural features of Dexter's solo, and the interactions
    between the performers. The following topics are addressed: basic motivic
    building blocks and their deviation from the tune; examples of polyrhythm;
    an analysis of Gordon's substantial cadenza; and Gordon's use of quotation.

    Ideas from phenomenology and practice theory are applied to the experiences

    social practice. Edmund Husserl's writings on time consciousness are applied
    to the concepts of additive and divisive time, and the resulting framework
    is used to show how a metal drummer actively shifts attention among temporal
    levels in perception to achieve various musical goals. If perception is
    practice, practice theory's insights into human action apply to it.

    This is the first book to discuss in detail how rap music is put together
    musically. Whereas a great deal of popular music scholarship dismisses music
    analysis as irrelevant or of limited value, the present book argues that it
    can be crucial to cultural theory. It is unique for bringing together
    perspectives from music theory, musicology, cultural studies, critical
    theory, and communications. It is also the first scholarly book to discuss
    rap music in Holland, and the rap of Cree Natives in Canada, in addition to
    such mainstream artists as Ice Cube. It is the first scholarly book to
    propose detailed analysis of rap songs and to lay out a genre system for
    rap. It theorizes issues of local and global geographies, discussing both
    mainstream artists like Ice Cube and more localized artists in Holland and
    Canada. The book presents a truly interdisciplinary theory of music, drawing
    from music theory, musicology, cultural studies, geography, and
    communications.

    drumming from timekeeping accompanist in the popular dance bands of the
    1930s to the interactive role assumed in the chamber ensembles of modern
    jazz in the 1940s. The stylistic innovations of Kenny Clarke and Max Roach
    are examined through transcription and analysis. Their conceptual
    approaches, drawn from West African polyrhythmic architecture, instigated a
    change in the role of the rhythm section and shaped the development of jazz.

  Abstract: >-
    Despite widespread and consequential debates over the lyrics and images of
    rap music, the actual music of this genre has received virtually no serious
    attention. Rhythmic strategies and rhetorical effects of rapped declamation
    and backing grooves are analyzed, using as an example Public Enemy's 1989
    hit song Fight the power. The social significance of polyrhythms in African
    musics suggests that the overt critical stance of many rap lyrics may be
    less important than the utopian or empowering experience of the music.

  Abstract: "Repetition has often been cast in a negative light, associated with immature or regressive states. This view is reflected in music criticism and pedagogy, recast in aesthetic terms and it also reappears in cultural criticism, attacking repetition as a dangerous tool for social control. Defenses that have been mounted in favor of repetition seem inadequate in that they tend to recategorize certain repetitive practices as not-quite-repetition, rather than defend repetitiontout court.\_This article uses examples from Electronic Dance Music (EDM) to provide an alternate approach to repetition that focuses on the experience of pleasure instead of a static attribution of aesthetic or ethical value. In particular, this is explored through three concepts:\_ repetition as process, repetition as prolongation of pleasure, and process itself as pleasurable. Underlying these concepts is a formulation of pleasure first coined as\_Funktionslust,\_or \"function pleasure,\" reconceived here as \"process pleasure.\""

  Abstract: >-
    In jazz improvisation, the meter of the original theme is strictly 
    preserved, and the middleground harmonies are maintained, while the 
    original melody is varied freely, especially with respect to its  grouping
    structure-where phrases begin and end. This poses problems for  theories of
    phrase rhythm that rely on a tonal definition of the phrase.  In this paper,
    I propose a new approach to jazz phrase rhythm. First, I  divide a melody
    into segments on the basis of four criteria. Then I  classify each segment
    on the basis of its relationship to the meter and  to surrounding segments.
    The result is a hierarchy of metrically defined  phrases. Phrase rhythm
    consonance and dissonance are  the alignment or misalignment of phrases with
    the meter. Skilled  soloists manipulate phrase rhythm as they would any
    other element of a  solo. I conclude with an ambiguous example, to
    demonstrate how  phrase-rhythm analysis can present competing
    interpretations of the same  passage.

  Abstract: >-
    In many styles of jazz, performances follow a pre-determined metrical
    scheme, with very little room for spontaneous alteration. Compared to
    common-practice music, the metrical hierarchy in jazz is extremely deep and
    rigid. This top-down convention affects the metrical perception of the
    experienced listener, but cannot completely overcome limitations to the
    bottom-up mechanism of metrical perception. I illustrate the interaction of
    metrical convention and perception with several examples of metrical shift
    in the solo recordings of Bill Evans, in which an apparently irregular
    surface conceals underlying fidelity to the metrical scheme.

  Abstract: >-
    This dissertation offers the first large-scale analytical study of the
    instrumental music of Frank Zappa (1940-1993). Following initial commentary
    in Chapter 1 on the problems of categorization in the repertoire, Chapter 2
    offers a preliminary discussion of  style  and form   in Zappa's music.
    Regarding style, I detail the fallouts of Zappa's unique early musical
    education as well as the influence of his guitar playing in his
    compositional style. My investigation of form explores the formal
    implications of melodic repetition, examining non-repeating forms
    characteristic of the  hybrid  music and repeating forms utilizing variation
    procedures such as contour retention  and  isomelism .                
    Chapter 3 is devoted to rhythm and meter in Zappa's music. The primary
    topics of this chapter are various types of rhythmic/metrical conflict,
    including polymeter, metrical dissonance , and rhythmic dissonance , which
    are explained in part as an attempted merging of advanced compositional
    techniques and rock/pop music norms. A theoretical discussion of rhythmic
    dissonance, which is Zappa's trademark rhythmic device, comprises the bulk
    of the chapter.                 Chapter 4 offers a Lydian theory  for
    Zappa's diatonic music, loosely adapted from George Russell's seminal jazz
    theory  The Lydian Chromatic Concept  (1953). This theory views the Lydian
    scale as representing a tonic state in Zappa's music due to its special
    static attributes. It introduces the concept of a Lydian system , containing
    a limited group of diatonic modes related to a common Lydian scale. Within,
    I demonstrate how the pitch structures of non-Lydian modes are related
    abstractly to those of the Lydian tonic, and follow by considering  pedal
    substitutions  and progressions  within the Lydian system.                
    Chapter 5 is devoted to Zappa's non-diatonic music. The first section of
    this chapter explores Zappa's methods of chromatic  pitch organization,
    including pitch-class diversity, chromatic saturation  , and symmetry . The
    second section investigates a system of composition based on a Chord Bible 
    of Zappa's own devising. This section includes a preliminary recreation of
    certain aspects of Chord Bible and a discussion of the compositional
    employment of Chord-Bible harmony in the series of orchestral works composed
    circa 1977-1982.

    The regularity of the 12-bar blues and 32-bar song form, while providing a
    consistent framework for traditional jazz improvisation, also prompted
    performers to expand these formulas with new harmonic and rhythmic
    techniques. In his piano solos Hancock reveals a highly inventive approach
    to rhythm, accomplished through techniques that include polyrhythm,
    hypermeter, accentual shift, and displaced motivic repetition. Hancock's
    solo from the composition Eye of the hurricane, a 12-measure blues in F
    minor, from the 1965 album Maiden voyage is examined, and displacement from
    the surface metric level up through higher levels of hypermetric structure
    is indicated.

  Abstract: >-
    A presentation of terminology for metric strategies is followed by musical
    analyses considering the standard jazz composition "Autumn Leaves."
    Transcriptions of solos on the tune by pianists Keith Jarrett from the
    Charles Lloyd Quartet recording "Dream Weaver" (Atlantic) and Herbie Hancock
    from the Miles Davis Quintet recording "Miles in Europe" (Columbia) are
    examined. Both improvisations consistently maintain the repeated 32-bar form
    of "Autumn Leaves," but the pitch and metric strategies of the solos
    frequently create conflicts with the composition's underlying harmonic
    progression and meter. By these local alterations to the harmonic and metric
    structure, both Jarrett and Hancock solve a number of the key problems of
    form and formal redundancy in popular-song form improvisation.

  Abstract: >-
    The 'Second Quintet' (the Miles Davis Quintet of the mid-1960s) was one of
    the most innovative and influential groups in the history of the genre. Each
    of the musicians who performed with Davis—saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist
    Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams—went on to a
    successful career as a top player. The studio recordings released by this
    group made profound contributions to improvisational strategies, jazz
    composition, and mediation between mainstream and avant-garde jazz, yet most
    critical attention has focused instead on live performances or the
    socio-cultural context of the work. Treating six different studio recordings
    in depth—E.S.P., Miles smiles, Sorcerer, Nefertiti, Miles in the sky, and
    Filles de Kilimanjaro—analysis takes into account contemporary reviews of
    the recordings, interviews with the five musicians, and relevant
    larger-scale cultural studies of the era, as well as two previously
    unexplored sources: the studio outtakes and Wayne Shorter's Library of
    Congress composition deposits.

  Abstract: >-
    American jazz pianist and composer Dave Brubeck has contributed
    significantly to sacred choral literature. Between 1967 and 1992, he
    composed seventeen extended works, most with sacred texts, drawn from the
    Old and New Testaments, Union Prayer Book of Reform Judaism, Martin Luther
    King, Chief Seattle, and his wife Iola. They include oratorios, cantatas, a
    festive Christmas pageant, a Mass, and a set of variations based on
    Gregorian chants. Compositionally, they combine elements of jazz, including
    improvised sections, with polyrhythms, polytonality, and twelve-tone rows.
    These works have been commissioned by the Union of American Hebrew
    Congregations, American Lutheran Church Women, and National Association of
    Pastoral Musicians; the Midland, Honolulu, New Haven, and Hartford symphony
    orchestras; and the Roman Catholic church for the 1987 visit of Pope John
    Paul II; and have been performed by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and
    Gregg Smith Singers.                 This study documents Brubeck's sacred
    choral compositions and examines the social factors and cultural contexts
    which contributed to their writing; analyzes the works to identify
    compositional procedures utilized, observe stylistic influences, and
    summarize the composer's style as a choral composer; and assesses and
    evaluates them from the viewpoints of the music journalist, scholar, and
    church musician. Sixty-five musical examples and extensive quotations from
    the composer's program notes are included.                 A biographical
    introduction surveys Brubeck's early life, ensembles, recordings, world
    tours, performance highlights, major compositions, social conscience, and
    recognitions. A chapter on sacred sound and social change discusses
    compositions by Duke Ellington, Leonard Bernstein, and Paul Winter. Each of
    Brubeck's sacred choral compositions is described and discussed. A lengthy
    analysis of The Light in the Wilderness, with musical examples, is included.
    Compositional influences, including Darius Milhaud, Arnold Schonberg, Igor
    Stravinsky, Bela Bartok, Charles Ives, J. S. Bach, Duke Ellington and other
    jazz musicians, and sounds from world cultures are identified and discussed.
    Brubeck's style as a choral composer is summarized in terms of text
    selection, rhythm, melody, harmony, instrumentation, improvisation, and
    structural devices. Critical commentary from newspapers and journals is
    included throughout the study. An extensive bibliography and catalog of
    Brubeck's sacred choral compositions, with historic and performance
    information, complete the examination.

  Abstract: >-
    Brubeck contributed to the development of jazz piano by the systematic
    application of unusual meters, polyrhythms, and polytonality. He expanded
    the concept of free improvisation within the context of odd meters. Through
    the integration of classical and jazz elements Brubeck helped to pave the
    way for other jazz musicians and to create new markets for jazz. He also
    promulgated the cause of jazz and, in so doing, increased intercultural
    understanding and goodwill.

  Abstract: "The 1965 Rolling Stones' hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\" epitomizes domineering masculinity and aggressive sexuality. Saturated with unrelenting rhythms, emphatic vocal delivery, cocky and phallocentric lyrics, musical climaxes, and abrasive guitar timbres, \"Satisfaction\" has been regarded by many scholars and music critics as the anthem of the cock rock genre-a music representative of male power and domination. Yet despite the song's association with a particular type of (white) male-identified, virile (hetero)sexuality, it has been covered by a variety of musicians of different races, genders, and sexualities. This thesis explores three cross-gender covers of \"Satisfaction\" recorded and performed by PJ Harvey and Björk (duet, 1994), Britney Spears (2000), and Cat Power (2000). Using theories of intertextuality, this project examines the ways in which all three musicians manipulate and subvert the dominant paradigms of the original song.\_"

  Abstract: >-
    Frank Rosolino was one of the greatest innovators of the jazz trombone.
    Rosolino was born August 20, 1926 and died November 26,
    1978.                 Seven improvised solos are analyzed in this paper and
    were transcribed by this writer. The solos span a period from 1956 through
    1978. The analyzation includes how he used different alterations and
    extensions with the dominant seventh chord. His use of vertical and
    horizontal lines are explored as well as his use of rhythm in his
    improvisation reveals his use of three-notes-to-the-beat, syncopation, and
    hemiola. The choice of melodic devices and phrasing ability are also studied
    and show his ability to use a variety of musical elements. Range and
    performance devices are considered as well.                 It is concluded
    that Rosolino does not use any alterations that are considered out of the
    ordinary. He does use all the common alterations and extensions of the
    dominant seventh chord. Rosolino uses vertical and horizontal lines, but
    seems to prefer vertical lines. Rhythm is the area where Rosolino developed
    the most when comparing his early and late solos.

    This chapter aims to show local cultural practices that appropriate the city
    and its mythology in novel ways that empower local individuals. It traces
    the issue of impermanence in the city's architectural history as a point of
    departure to explain the continuous re-signification of the city's urban
    landscapes by tijuanenses. It explores the relationships among musicians,
    fans, and the changing urban landscape of their city, including concert
    venues, clubs, bars, and dancing locales. It also uses Nor-tec music and
    videos as metaphors for the ambiguity of cultural meaning and discourse in a
    city like Tijuana. Its goal is to show that Nor-tec and Nor-tec-related
    expressive culture offer young tijuanenses alternative ways to
    territorialize and reterritorialize public spaces as well as hegemonic
    discourses of race, class, morality, and belonging in Tijuana.

  Abstract: >-
    This is a comprehensive work that highlights and discusses in detail a
    number of my compositions for the jazz piano trio. The jazz piano trio has
    traditionally involved three musicians; piano, bass, and drums or piano,
    guitar and bass. For the purposes of my dissertation, the compositions were
    written with the first trio format of piano, bass, and drums. It is my
    desire to couple traditional classical music forms and theoretical concepts
    with the jazz style and explain both the general history and the application
    to my compositions. For the compositions that are not influenced by
    traditional means, they are composed with their own specific music oriented
    goal in mind.                 The following compositions are analyzed and
    discussed; "Like Thad", a work reminiscent of composer Thad Jones' melodic
    and rhythmic styles. "Skylines", a 12-tone composition. "When I See Her
    Again" a composition focusing on text adaptation and metric contrast. The
    text was composed by Joseph Maffia. "Ethology" a work derived from modal
    implications designated through slash chords. "Her Name", a sonata-allegro
    composition which uses blues forms linked by Coltrane changes as the
    development. "La Tela de Arana" based on 2-3 and 3-2 forms of the clave
    pattern which also utilizes traditional latin-jazz elements.

  Abstract: >-
    Pianist and composer Andrew Hill (1931-2007) made significant contributions
    to the jazz idiom during the nearly fifty years he recorded, however his
    compositions and improvisational style have yet to be explored in great
    depth. His unique style, filled with rhythmic irregularities, harmonic
    dissonance and abrupt shifts in mood, developed out of the conventions of
    hard bop. By the time Hill led his second recording session in 1963 (his
    first for Blue Note), his playing had developed more fully with the
    incorporation of a freer approach to melody, harmony and rhythm. His
    compositions often maintain form and make use of traditional chord symbols,
    but harmonic and rhythmic "looseness" adds a degree of complexity and
    discontinuity, which may in part account for Hill's relative obscurity. In
    2000, he began receiving numerous awards for his playing and composing from 
    Down Beat, Jazz Journalist  and other publications. The main purpose of this
    study is the presentation of seven previously unpublished transcriptions of
    Hill's improvised solos spanning 1959 to 2005. In addition, this paper will
    provide a biography of Andrew Hill's early life and recording career and
    will present several previously unpublished compositions by Hill. For this
    study, I conducted interview with several of his former collaborators:
    trumpeters Ron Horton and Charles Tolliver, multi-reedist Greg Tardy and
    bassist Scott Colley. This contribution, I hope, will help to increase
    Hill's prominence as a significant jazz figure and shed some light on this
    underrepresented artist.

  Abstract: >-
    This dissertation defines musical polymeter in relation to a theory of meter
    as a hierarchical structure. It also disambiguates polymeter from related
    concepts and defines a complete classification of polymetric possibilities
    using a thorough, analytical approach. The system accommodates both
    isochronous and non-isochronous meters and classifies polymetric structures
    based on the relationships between corresponding levels in the component
    meters. Such levels are related by factors such as proportionality,
    coincidence, and periodicity. The classification is created by first
    constructing a list of all conceivable combinations of relationships between
    corresponding metrical levels and then eliminating those arrangements that
    are impossible. The system is illustrated with numerous figures. A concise
    labeling system is also provided. The final chapter of this work presents
    various analytical techniques, including graphical and quantitative methods.
    This system handles all different kinds of coordinated polymeter in one
    conceptual framework. It also suggests an organized approach to composing
    with polymeter and provides polymetric configurations that may not have been
    previously explored by composers and theorists.

  Abstract: >-
    Examines the effect of meter on the use of tones in bebop-style jazz
    improvisations, in particular, whether there are other periodicities besides
    the basic metrical structures that affect the use of tones. On the metrical
    positions traditionally thought to be important, musicians emphasize the
    important tones of the underlying tonality, particularly the first degree of
    the scale. On the other metrical positions the tone-frequency profiles
    displayed emphasis also on the other tones in the diatonic scale. Aside from
    the basic metrical structures that are traditionally thought to be
    important, the investigation of the use of tones revealed no other clear
    periodicities. These results support the idea that in this type of music the
    basic metrical structures conform to the traditional view of metrical
    organization. Moreover, together with the empirical literature on meter they
    also support the kind of metrical weighting discussed in Järvinen (see RILM
    ref]1995-02403/ref]).

  Abstract: "This study examines several attributes of rhythm and meter in some vocal-melodic \"hooks,\" or easily remembered musical moments, of the Dave Matthews Band. In order to display analytical results, a table was crafted to collapse rhythmic and metric events in a given hook into a single representative measure. For those who may prefer a modular visualization, the author placed the same data in a circle graph, intended to represent a measure as a metric cycle. As a final measure, DMB data were compared to other rock hooks encompassing a broad spectrum of stylistic characteristics. In this particular case, the former displayed greater depth and variety of syncopation, albeit marginally in some considerations.\_"

  Abstract: >-
    Drummer Christian Vander's work with the progressive rock band Magma is
    analyzed within the context of the writings of LeRoi Jones (later known as
    Imamu Amiri Baraka) and John Corbett, who have both written about the use of
    outer-space imagery in African-Americna music as a badge of "outsider"
    identity. For both authors, extraterrestrial imagery is an emblem of social
    disidentification. Although Vander is white, his music and cosmology have
    interesting parallels with the theories of Jones and Corbett, demonstrating
    that perhaps their conceptions of "otherness" are not strictly racially
    bound. The intertextual aspects of the music of Magma are examined in
    relation to the art music of Carl Orff and the jazz of John Coltrane.

  Abstract: >-
    The Black Atlantic rhythmic diaspora, be it realized in jazz, blues, gospel,
    reggae, rock, candomblé, cumbia, hip-hop, or whatever, seems to have
    widespread capacity to facilitate dance, engagement, social interaction,
    expression and catharsis. The reasons for this are examined. Black Atlantic
    rhythm is founded on the idea of groove or feel, which forms a kinetic
    framework for reliable prediction of events and time pattern communication,
    its power cemented by repetition and engendered movement. Overlaid on this
    are characteristic devices that include syncopation, overlay, displacement,
    off-beat phrasing, polyrhythm/polymeter, hocketing, heterophony, swing,
    speech-based rhythms, and call-and-response. Using an evolutionary argument,
    it is noted that nearly all of these have at their heart the establishment
    of perceptual multiplicity or rivalry, affecting expectation, which acts as
    either a message or a message enhancement technique (via increased
    engagement and focusing of attention), or both. The causal path for the
    remaining devices is based on adopting structures shared with speech,
    notably prosody, conversational interaction, and narrative. Several examples
    illustrate how, particularly in jazz and jazz-related forms, extensions and
    relatively complex creative adaptations of traditional African and African
    diasporic rhythmic techniques are a natural consequence of a culture of
    questioning and reflection that encompasses maintenance of historical
    reference and accommodation to innovation.

  Abstract: >-
    The music and history of Jerry González's Fort Apache Band, as it pertains
    to the broad spectrum of Latin jazz, is the purpose of this study. A brief
    history of Latin jazz was given. Special attention was given to the method
    of rhythmic organization, known as  clave  (not to be confused with the
    instruments known as claves). The author presented musical excerpts from
    Ragtime piano music and Bebop tunes as they pertain to the development of
    Latin jazz.                 The author tracked the musical development and
    careers of the brothers, and founding members, Jerry and Andy González;
    including their musical background and training, early sideman work with
    seminal figures in both Jazz and Latin music, and other artistic events that
    led to them forming the Fort Apache Band. A chronology and examination of
    their recordings on the Enja, Sunnyside, and Milestone/Fantasy record labels
    was presented. The backgrounds of other key members in the lineage of the
    Fort Apache Band was also given. Musical examples of various stylistic
    attributes of the band were exhibited.                 A full-length
    transcription of an entire song, Little Rootie Tootie,  by Thelonious Monk,
    from their 1989 Sunnyside Records release  Rumba Para Monk,  was made and
    prepared by the author and included as an appendix. The harmony, melody, and
    form of the Monk composition were analyzed. Important traits of the Fort
    Apache Band's performance style were analyzed, including each instrument's
    role, Jazz performance aspects, and Latin performance aspects. Traditional
    methodology, such as Roman numeral harmonic analysis, and discussion of
    chord/scale relationships in solo Jazz performance, were applied. For an
    analysis of the band's adherence to the   clave  rhythm, a non-traditional
    methodology was utilized by using arrows to show the rhythmic alignment of
    various instruments' parts with the  clave  rhythm. A selected bibliography
    pertaining to the research is included.                 This work also
    includes, as appendicies, a glossary of terms that pertain to this music and
    a flow chart documenting the various influences that led to the formation of
    the Fort Apache Band. Additionally, a notation guide for percussion as a
    component to the transcription, a lead sheet of the Thelonious Monk
    composition  Little Rootie Tootie,  and a consent form to release the
    transcription for this essay are also included as appendicies.

  Abstract: >-
    The purpose of this study is to provide transcriptions and analyses of eight
    historically significant jazz piano improvisations from the Miles Davis
    groups between 1955-1968. The four significant pianists from this era were
    Red Garland, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly and Herbie Hancock. Two solos were
    selected from each pianist's work with Davis for transcription and are
    presented in chronological order. Criteria for their selection were: (1)
    degree to which the recorded improvisation is indicative of each artist's
    style, and (2) the improvisations contrasting value within this set. The
    improvisations were analyzed in three basic categories: (1) melodic
    contribution, (2) harmonic contribution, and (3) rhythmic contribution.
    There are numerous books of transcribed solos from all different
    instruments, however, few of these contain in-depth analyses of the music.
    Even fewer compare related artists over a span of time in the context of
    their musical contributions. This study shows the link between these four
    major pianists and an evolution of jazz piano improvisation through an
    analysis of selected improvisations. The study should be useful to students
    of jazz piano, or any instrument, in their quest to understand the history
    of jazz piano performance and provide them with the transcriptions and
    analyses to aid their study. In addition, historical information is included
    for each pianist, documenting their musical education and the influences
    that helped to create their unique style.

  Abstract: "Bebop or bop1 provides, in the words of the noted jazz scholar Thomas Owens, \"the lingua franca of jazz, serving as the principal musical language of thousands of jazz musicians. It also affects the way earlier jazz styles are played, and is the parent language of many action ('free jazz') and fusion players, who from time to time return to the idiom, not to parody it but to honor it and to reaffirm their musical roots\" (Owens 1995, 4). Further, bop is considered by some to be the first movement in jazz that provides a conscious aesthetic exploration of its material that moves beyond the realm of entertainment. I develop a new method for jazz analysis and pedagogy, the tonally adjusted species model.2 I use this model for an in-depth study of Charlie Parker's recorded improvised solo to \"Ornithology\" of March 28, 1946.3 Comparing \"How High the Moon\"4 with Charlie Parker and Benny Harris's contrafact of it, \"Ornithology,\" provides appropriate con text for the analysis of Parker's solo.5 The essay closes with suggestions for jazz pedagogy based on this new method.\_"

  Abstract: >-
    The musical language of jazz pianist Bill Evans is investigated. Two
    analytic methodologies are used to uncover recurring formulaic language in
    his improvisations. The analyses involved an examination of nine improvised
    solos to identify the frequency of occurrence of melodic formulas, thereby
    establishing a hierarchy of Evans's most commonly used formulas. Individual
    formulas were studied in relation to chord function and to one another to
    ascertain whether an interconnected formulaic network of analogous themes
    exists within Evans's internal grammar. Findings point to a high degree of
    analogous similarity between the formulas themselves and suggest a
    hierarchically organized formulaic network of themes.

  Abstract: >-
    The music of John Coltrane's last group-his 1965-67 quintet-has been
    misrepresented, ignored and reviled by critics, scholars and fans, primarily
    because it is a music built on a fundamental and very audible disunity that
    renders a new kind of structural unity. Many of those who study Coltrane's
    music have thus far attempted to approach all elements in his last works
    comparatively, using harmonic and melodic models as is customary regarding
    more conventional jazz structures. This approach is incomplete and
    misleading, given the music's conceptual underpinnings. The present study is
    meant to provide an analytical model with which listeners and scholars might
    come to terms with this music's more radical elements. I use Coltrane's own
    observations concerning his final music, Jonathan Kramer's temporal
    perception theory, and Evan Parker's perspectives on atomism and laminarity
    in mid 1960s British improvised music to analyze and contextualize the
    symbiotically related temporal disunity and resultant structural unity that
    typify Coltrane's 1965-67 works. I also filter all of this through my
    experience as a listener. My investigation treats, separately, Coltrane's
    solos of the period 1965-1967 as well as temporal and structural
    complexities in Coltrane's deployment and expansion of a jazz rhythm
    section; I then demonstrate, based on new historical research, the
    manifestation of similar but hitherto unexplored modes of expression in
    today's jazz and classical avant-garde as a way to begin to gauge Coltrane's
    long-term impact on improvised music that exists outside the 'jazz' canon.
    In Chapter 1, I present my bipartite analytical model of soloistic atomism
    and rhythm section laminarity, relating these to Kramer's concepts of
    multiply-directed linear and vertical time respectively. I then explore
    Coltrane's own words concerning his final music and regarding unity and
    disunity as he conceived them. Chapter 2 constitutes an examination of
    atomism in Coltrane's solos, in which I demonstrate that atomistic features
    increase in Coltrane's late works; this soloistic atomism is one component
    of my analytical model. Chapter 3 explores rhythm section laminarity,
    demonstrating the abandonment of tempo and pulse in favor of a more minimal
    aesthetic. Chapter 4 is devoted to a study of the way in which the
    innovative structural principles in Coltrane's final works are used by
    improvising composers Anthony Braxton and Paul Dunmall. As with Coltrane,
    both artists' compositions blur the boundaries between jazz and classical
    music, their work representing two transgenerational approaches to
    Coltrane's legacy. The sound examples in chapters 1, 3 and 4 can be found
    attached as accompanying wave files.

  Abstract: "Explores connections between the notion of the 'hook' and several recurring accent patterns found in\_rock\_music from the 1980s. Seven syncopated accent patterns are identified, listing more than 150 songs from the 1980s that use one or more of these patterns. The accent patterns help create hooks in three main ways: 1) one of the patterns is used to create a strong title hook, as in Rick Springfield's hit 'I've done everything for you', the title of which is set with a syncopated and distinct rhythmic pattern; 2) a hook in the form of a 'significant gesture' that usually precedes the chorus, as in the pre-chorus 'My-my-my-my-ah-woo' gesture from The Knack's 'My Sharona'; and 3) a hook involving the combination of a repeated accent pattern with a recurring pitch pattern, as in the guitar introduction to AC/DC's 'For those about to\_rock'. By pointing out that these three examples all use the same accent pattern in significant, but different, ways, the prominence of this and other patterns is acknowledged while furthering the discourse on the notion of the 'hook'."

  Abstract: >-
    Ernest Anthony 'Tito' Puente (1923-2000) has been recognized as a leading
    exponent of 20th-c. timbale performance in the U.S. He was also recognized
    as a pioneer of Latin jazz, which includes hybrids of various Cuban styles
    including the mambo. This research dissertation comprised research and style
    analysis of selected Tito Puente timbale solos, in order to identify
    stylistic elements that could be traced to jazz or mambo conventions, to
    identify related stylistic trends over the course of Puente's career, and to
    identify paradigm figures or phrases of Puente's solo lexicon. The four
    solos selected for analysis were Mambo beat from his 1957 album Night Beat,
    Corta el Bonche from his 1965 album Carnaval en Harlem, Ran kan kan from his
    1984 album El rey, and Cha cha cha mambo from his 1999 album Mambo birdland.
    The style analysis included observations of the solos and related contextual
    elements. Although some elements of the selected compositions were
    jazz-derived, Puente adhered strictly to mambo conventions in his timbale
    solos. He developed his solos based on a few key motivic cells, including
    the use of offbeats, hemiolas, and phrase-extending repetition and
    development. His phrases were constructed with a sense of tension and repose
    relative to the rhythm of the clave cells inherent in each phrase of each
    solo. The exception to these findings was Puente's composition Cha cha cha
    mambo, which was found to be a stylistic anomaly in formal construction and
    style as well as solo construction. Based upon the findings of this study,
    Puente's primary contribution to the genre of Latin jazz was his adaptation
    of standard jazz compositions into Afro-Caribbean styles. In the conclusion
    of this study, recommendations were made concerning the need for future
    research of Puente's prolific output of recorded music.

  Abstract: >-
    The purpose of the following study is to identify the musical elements that
    constitute the performance style of Phineas Newborn Jr., one of the
    preeminent jazz pianists in history. This dissertation presents
    transcriptions of six improvised solos by Newborn that were recorded for the
    Contemporary label in the 1960s, including "Oleo," "Juicy Lucy," "Daahoud,"
    "Theme for Basie," "Four," and "He's a Real Gone Guy." Reoccurring musical
    motives found in the transcribed solos are codified into the  Motivic
    Catalog  in chapter 4. Each motive is analyzed using terminology from Jerry
    Coker's  Elements of the Jazz Language for the Developing Improviser.  The
    melodic implications of Newborn's style are addressed in chapter 4. A
    comparative analysis of Newborn's solo on "Oleo" and Charlie Parker's solo
    on "Thriving on a Riff" is made to examine the similarities between their
    performance styles, revealing a strong similarity in their improvisation
    styles, and suggests Newborn's melodic style is most closely associated with
    the bebop style. The stylistic interpretation of Newborn's playing and his
    use of texture are also addressed in chapter 4. Certain textural devices
    identified in Newborn's style are cross-referenced with other jazz pianists
    who exhibit similar techniques, thereby providing a context of his playing
    within the jazz tradition and his own unique contributions as a pianist. In
    conclusion, he uses textural devices to manipulate the principle of tension
    and release.

  Abstract: >-
    Traces the evolution of rhythmic innovations, concepts, devices, etc. as
    they appear in the compositions of jazz musician Don Ellis (1934-1978).
    Although he was known primarily for his odd-meter works for big band, Ellis
    experimented with many different rhythmic ideas in his earlier works for
    smaller groups. In most cases these experiments laid the foundation for his
    later work, either directly or indirectly; even those concepts which Ellis
    ultimately rejected will be seen as important steps in his development.
    Topics addressed include meter, polyrhythm, and tempo, as well as numerous
    developmental devices. Insights into the context of jazz at that time are
    provided through comparisons with the music of Ellis's contemporaries, and
    comments from critics and jazz historians. Ellis's own influences are also
    examined. Also featured is an interview with Hari Har Rao, who was largely
    responsible for introducing Ellis to the rhythmic concepts of Indian music.

  Abstract: >-
    Nat Adderley was a musical innovator and accomplished improviser of the hard
    bop jazz movement. His abilities as a jazz musician rivaled many of his
    musical contemporaries, even though nearly half of his career was spent in
    the shadow of his more famous brother, saxophonist Cannonball Adderley. Nat
    Adderley was not only known for his outstanding cornet improvisations, but
    also for his compositional output. Many of his works, such as the Work Song,
    are now part of the standard jazz repertoire.                 This purpose
    of this project was to provide an evolutionary look at the musical career of
    Nat Adderley through the study of his composition Work Song. Five improvised
    solos over this composition from differing points during the course of his
    career were transcribed and analyzed to show his evolution as a jazz
    improviser and cornetist, and also to show growth of complexity and
    maturation of improvisational style within the solos themselves. The
    transcribed solos are included within the document, both in pure transcribed
    form and in analyzed form.                 Supplementary materials include
    biographies of Nat Adderley, both professional and personal, and a record
    discography of Work Song and his complete recorded albums.

    Presents a transcription and Schenkerian analysis of Bill Evans's two
    eight-measure sections that precede the return of the original melody of
    "Stella by Starlight." Shows how Evans's performance layers duple/triple
    rhythms, how he delays the final element of that process, and how he
    smoothly transforms the first process into a second. Concludes that Evans's
    layering of three pianos create a rich orchestral and compelling swing
    sound. Regards what he does with this pieces as "simply stellar."

  Abstract: >-
    Schenkerian analysis of the author's transcription of Bill Evans's
    performance of four choruses of All of you (recorded on Marian McPartland's
    radio program, Piano Jazz) shows that Evans uses polymeter, accentual shift,
    and combinations of these effects not only in ways analogous to the ways in
    which tonal instability is used, but also in concert with tonal structures,
    so as to advance dramatic, rhetorical, and gestural strategies. Analysis
    also shows that the patterns of pitches projected by Evans's techniques of
    displacement create interesting and sophisticated relationships to one
    another, to prolongational structures, and to the theme on which he
    improvises.

    In an exploration of the funk groove, two of the most influential artists of
    the late 1960s and the 1970s are examined: James Brown and George
    Clinton/Parliament. Aiming to understand funk not only as objectified
    musical meaning but also as lived experience, musical events provide a
    starting point for considering how their organization creates the funk
    listener's pleasure. Issues surrounding race are examined in relation to the
    construction and consumption of funk, especially as relates to white
    listeners in the 1970s. Funk's crossover to international success among
    listeners of pop and rock music affected both the music itself and
    audiences' understanding of funk.

  Abstract: >-
    Jazz musicians are constantly communicating during their improvised
    performances. This paper focuses on the interactions that shape the overall
    metric structure in a recorded performance of Ron Carter's Blues for DP.
    During this performance the musicians transition from an initially
    established 12/8 meter to new double-time meters. Numerous musical
    indicators suggest that these changes are negotiated in real time. By
    tracking these indicators I argue that the fluid metric shifting results
    from metrical dissonance. The interactive process will be highlighted
    through a reduction of transcribed musical selections to their fundamental
    rhythmic and metrical components. By highlighting only the metrical
    structures and by grounding the analysis in the metrical models as set forth
    by Harald Krebs and Christopher Hasty, the interactive process of
    "suggesting," "responding to," and "settling on" will be outlined. Krebs's
    grouping dissonance (Gx/y) and displacement dissonance (Dx+y) labels
    quantify the moments of metrical dissonance. Hasty's model, as set forth in
    Meter as Rhythm, accounts for the listener's perceptions of the resulting
    metrical dissonances. This paper concludes by outlining the following
    interactive tendencies that result from metrical dissonance. First, there is
    a tendency for the soloist to initiate the interactive suggestions. Second,
    there is a consistency in the type of metrical dissonance introduced-Krebs's
    G4/3 and G3/2-and to where the "settling on" occurs-in the â€˜turnaround'
    section of the form. And finally, isolated moments of musical dissonance
    occur when there is no metrical response.

  Abstract: >-
    This paper considers some of the issues involved in the analysis of rhythm
    and meter in electronic dance music. It begins by considering metrical
    dissonance and ambiguity within the context of a layered approach to musical
    meter; it also highlights some of the distinctive ways in which these
    phenomena are manifested in this repertory. The second half of the paper
    focuses on the use of asymmetrical patterns in electronic dance music and
    considers some broader questions of rhythmic and metrical theory.
    Throughout, the paper draws upon a number of different music-theoretical
    sources, including work by Harald Krebs, Jay Rahn, and Christopher Hasty, as
    well as scholarship in ethnomusicology and cognitive science.

  Abstract: >-
    The rhythmic and metrical qualities of electronic dance music (EDM) are
    clearly among its most prominent and appreciated features. Yet scholarship
    on rhythm, as well as popular discourse surrounding EDM, often frames the
    pervasively duple meters that characterize popular dance-based styles as
    simplistic and limited in capacity. Given the allure of EDM's temporal
    qualities, how do musicians devise creative solutions to the constraints of
    its duple metrical organization? This question is addressed through a
    consideration of embedded grouping dissonance, one of several distinctive
    rhythmic phenomena found in EDM. In theorizing embedded grouping dissonance,
    recent music-theoretical formulations of 'metrical dissonance' are expanded,
    describing similar occurrences without addressing this specific phenomenon.
    Embedded grouping dissonance is then situated in relation to EDM's
    technologically mediated means of production, arguing that this rhythmic
    technique exemplifies recurring principles of design that shape and reflect
    the aesthetics of electronic dance music on a broad scale.

  Abstract: >-
    Rhythmic and metrical characteristics are at the forefront of musical
    experience in electronic dance music, a broad category of popular music
    encompassing styles such as techno, house, trance, and drum 'n' bass. The
    rhythmic and metrical organization of electronic dance music is explored
    from themicro-level to the complete DJ set, uncovering recurring principles
    of design that shape this repertory at multiple structural levels. The
    methodology employed integrates musical analysis, current theories of rhythm
    and meter, and ethnographic fieldwork. Nine complete tracks are analyzed and
    transcribed. Thevoices of DJs, producers, and fans provide important musical
    details as well as a broad sociocultural grounding. In both large- and
    small-scale organization, electronic dance music tends toward duple
    patterning, but within these constraints it creates metrical diversity
    through asymmetrical rhythms, displaced patterns, and conflicting rhythmic
    groupings. Rhythm and meter interact closely with texture:textural processes
    almost always have metrical ramifications, and independent textural layers
    frequently lead to metrical dissonance. Rhythmic and metrical experience in
    electronic dance music often involves ambiguity: the beginning point of a
    pattern may be unclear, and the absence of layers of motion may undermine
    the clarity of metrical perception. Formal organization is modular and
    open-ended. Three types of repeating entities-loops (short rhythm patterns),
    sequences (multi-measure instrumental combinations), and records-function as
    building blocks that can be combined and juxtaposed with great flexibility.
    While each constructive element governs a different level of musical
    structure, all are based upon cyclical repetition rather than linear
    progression. The modular design of electronic dance music both reflects and
    supports the interactive nature of its creation and reception. Dancers
    interact individually with the music and communally with each other and the
    DJ. The DJ uses fixed materials within a flexible performance that develops
    in response to a dancing audience. Though technology is central to this
    experience, it does not dominate it; rather, the creative and performative
    contexts of electronic dance music reveal an ongoing negotiation between
    humans and technology. The related book is cited as RILM 2006-13629.

  Abstract: >-
    This dissertation takes a long view of the history of temporal constructions
    in writings on music, examining the connections between theories of musical
    meter and changing conceptualizations of time. Since antiquity, writers on
    music have grappled with the nature of meter, and throughout the history of
    Western music their formulations have continually evolved, reflecting
    fundamental reevaluations not only of music but also of time itself. Drawing
    on paradigms from the history of science and the history of philosophy, this
    study investigates the connections between ideas on meter and time from the
    seventeenth century to the present day, and illustrates ways in which these
    two conceptions have mutually informed one another. It fills a conspicuous
    gap in studies of meter and of the history of music theory while bringing
    together diverse strands of thought in a genealogy of temporal
    conceptualizations. Four case studies form the body of the dissertation,
    each focusing on a particular moment in meter's history. Two analytical
    chapters supplement these case studies, incorporating current theories with
    historical perspectives on time and meter. In drawing the history of meter
    through to the twenty-first century, this dissertation offers a reflection
    on the claims made about temporality in our current theories, and a way of
    understanding meter and temporality as two pieces of a shared conceptual
    network.

  Abstract: >-
    This dissertation is a historical study of the cultural, social and musical
    influences that have led to the use of West African music in the
    compositions and performance of Art Blakey, Yusef Lateef, and Randy Weston.
    Many jazz musicians have utilized West African music in their musical
    compositions. Blakey, Lateef and Weston were not the first musicians to do
    so, however they were chosen for this dissertation because their
    experiences, influences, and music clearly illustrate the importance that
    West African culture has played in the lives of African American jazz
    musicians.                 Born during the Harlem Renaissance each of these
    musicians was influenced by the political views and concepts that
    predominated African American culture at that time. Imperative among those
    influences were the concept of pan-Africanism, the writings of Marcus Garvey
    and the music of Duke Ellington. Additionally, Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke
    and Dizzy Gillespie three of the most important contributors to the bebop
    revolution made great impressions on Blakey, Lateef, and Weston. All three
    musicians traveled to West Africa, and while each visited Africa for
    different reasons, all three were greatly influenced by the music they heard
    and the musicians they interacted with. All of these influences led to
    significant use of West African music in the works of Blakey, Lateef and
    Weston.                 Blakey, Weston, and Lateef became professional
    musicians in their own rights during a period of intense civil rights
    activities in the United States. Civil Rights activism along with the
    liberation of African Nations inspired compositions and performances by
    these three musicians that incorporated elements of West African music with
    jazz. Through these activities Blakey, Weston, and Lateef were able to
    provide artistic commentary on the strides being made for the civil rights
    of both Africans and African Americans.

  Abstract: >-
    Around 1920, when jazz first became popular, many African-Americans called
    it the devil's music and regarded it as inferior to sacred music. Whites
    also severely criticized jazz, with its fast improvisations, polyrhythms,
    syncopations, and blues harmonies. Locations of performances, often brothels
    and speakeasies, were also causes of concern. There was less antagonism and
    fear of its influence when people became familiar with jazz by hearing it on
    the radio, mostly in composed arrangements played by white musicians. Rock
    and roll, which became popular in the 1950s, proved that jazz had opened
    American ears to the potential of African-American music.

  Abstract: "This article was prompted \_by a number \_of questions: \_How do we\_  approach \_the study \_of British \_dance band music of these vintage \_years?\_  Do they represent \_a golden age in quantity \_rather \_than quality? \_Is it\_  possible \_to construct \_criteria \_for deciding \_what is good and bad in this\_  music? I am particularly \_interested \_in asking these questions \_of dance\_  band music of the 1920s and 1930s because, despite the enormous\_  attraction \_dance bands held for a majority \_of people in the United\_  Kingdom \_between \_the two world wars, and despite this period's mythic\_  status as the \"golden era\" of the dance band (at least in the eyes of\_  the publicists \_for the record industry), \_it is not uncommon \_to find\_  dance band music neglected \_or despised (usually \_when compared \_to\_  \"real\" jazz) even by writers \_normally \_sympathetic \_to popular music. How do we explain the contradictory \_response \_to an old dance band\_  record \_summed \_up in the phrase \"wonderfully \_awful\"? \_Perhaps, \_in the\_  latter case, the answer is that such things \_as humor \_and sentimentality\_  are very period specific; \_they quickly \_become dated, and so an old\_  record \_often seems to lend insight \_into the way people felt at a specific\_  time, which, being past, in turn evokes nostalgia \_and a feeling \_of\_  empathy \_with those whose lifetimes \_preceded \_our own. At the same\_  time, it must be acknowledged \_that by responding \_in such a fashion\_  the meaning \_of the music to us differs \_from its meaning \_to its original\_  listeners--a \_neat illustration \_that history \_and aesthetics \_are not mutu-\_  ally exclusive \_categories."

    This dissertation discusses two jazz trombonists, David Steinmeyer and
    Curtis Fuller. Six solos performed by these two artists are analyzed for the
    purpose of studying and comparing their individual styles of playing. Each
    solo is analyzed melodically, harmonically, and rhythmically with musical
    excerpts from each solo included to provide emphasis on a particular
    area.                 This dissertation also includes comparisons of overall
    styles, full transcriptions of each solo, discographies for both artists,
    and brief biographical sketches of each artist. Although the artists play in
    different styles, they still share similar philosophies in approaching the
    performance of playing jazz trombone.

  Abstract: "I identify Tony Williams' formative drumset ideology as being emergent from his adaptive modeling of the feel, technique and creativity identified in the drumming of Art Blakey, Max Roach and Philly Joe Jones respectively and present the results of extensive textual and musicological research on Williams' formative practices between 1945 and 1969 as an archetype for cultivating originality in jazz drumset performance studies. I examine patterns of creative thought in the New York jazz community as they developed from the relative heteronomy of modernist bebop improvisation to the postmodernist aesthetic of jazz-rock fusion resulting in the emergence of collective autonomy in musical interaction and improvisation. My research reveals Willams' possession of autotelic personality and utilisation of learning techniques associated with heutagogy. Also identified is the prevalence of entrainment in the social and musical interactions of the New York jazz community and I interpret these qualities through the lens of the theory of complex adaptive systems as a model for learning in jazz drumset performance studies. I analyse Williams' ensemble and solo drumming in comparison to that of Blakey, Roach and Jones in addition to Roy Haynes by using an analytic schema designed specifically for identification of contrasting qualities in the voicing of rhythm and expression as revealed in the grouping and ordering of limbs in drumset performance. I present a complete stylistic overview of Williams' recorded output until 1969 including swing, avant garde, ballad, straight eighth-note and sixteenth-note oriented styles as well as complex temporal events such as polymetric superimposition, rubato, polytempo, superimposed metric modulation, metric modulation and tempo fluctuation.\_      "

  Abstract: >-
    In 1999, Nonesuch Records released a CD containing selected works of
    minimalist composer Steve Reich (b. 1936) remixed by prominent electronica
    artists. Reich Remixed was billed as an homage to the father of DJ/remix
    culture and the liner notes cite Reich as 'the original re-mixer,' stating
    boldly that 'mass culture has finally caught up to and embraced the fringe
    ideas that Reich was exploring in the 1960s.' This is an association with
    which Reich is not uncomfortable. Commenting on the DJ-as-remixer, Reich has
    said that 'here's a generation that doesn't just like what I do, they
    appropriate it!' Contributing artists on Reich Remixed, including Coldcut,
    DJ Spooky, and Howie B (Howard Bernstein), were supplied with multitrack
    recordings of Reich's works, allowing them to select, isolate, sample and
    manipulate individual instruments and parts to include in their remixes.
    According to Reich, the remixers worked autonomously, and his own
    involvement in the project was limited to selecting from the more than
    twenty mixes that were submitted for the project.

  Abstract: >-
    Evidence of a link between piano and drumming performance practices in
    western music dates back to at least the mid-nineteenth century. The modern
    construction of the piano had yet to be fully standardized when percussive
    techniques were being applied to its keyboard. Since that time, pianists and
    drummers (especially those involved with the creation of groove-based music)
    have grown closer and closer, participating in what remains a richly
    symbiotic relationship. This study examines parallels between piano and
    drumming performance practices in jazz. In this context, drumming is
    acknowledged as an important inspiration guiding the expression of rhythm
    and percussive attack by non-drummers, pianists in
    particular.                 Historical connections between pianism and
    drumming in jazz are addressed through an examination of those legacies that
    are widely believed to derive from West African drumming, European march and
    dance traditions, and various aspects of the so-called "Latin tinge" from
    the Caribbean and South America. Playing techniques are compared in part
    based on the premise that similarities in musical output flow naturally from
    congruencies in instrumental architecture. Percussive action unites pianists
    and drummers, as do shared abilities to create rhythmic layers through the
    independent functioning of multiple limbs. A discussion of ensemble roles
    reveals conceptual links, especially with regard to time-keeping, "comping,"
    and mutual approaches to the creation of groove and swing.                
    Transcriptions are employed to illustrate instances of widely adopted
    drumming-like gestures from the history of jazz with special attention paid
    to rhythmic counterpoint, complementation, and rudimental sticking patterns
    used by jazz pianists since the 1960's. Though a statistically small sample,
    interviews with ten professional jazz pianists support the essential
    findings of the study. Questions are raised throughout regarding the
    effectiveness of traditional jazz pedagogy in emphasizing the importance of
    drumming to non-drummer instrumental praxis.

    Transcript of a paper delivered at the IASPM (UK) conference, 1999. It seems
    very difficult-even impossible-to begin any activity with or about sounds
    without referring to categories such as 'kind', 'type', 'genre', 'style', or
    to metaphors like 'field', 'area', 'space'. Thinking about music, talking
    about music, making music: all these activities imply reference to a more or
    less detailed taxonomy, whose structure-not to mention its very existence-is
    too often taken for granted. Easy access to the world's diverse musical
    cultures (and so to even more 'types of music') has encouraged expanding and
    articulating existing taxonomies. However, some of the categories that we
    use date from more than 2000 years ago, and have been developed differently
    in different musical and/or national cultures. So, while categories like
    'genre' or 'style' seem to be used mainly to 'put some order' and reduce the
    overall entropy in the musical universe (or, at least, in our talks and
    writings about music), sometimes they seem to create even more disorder and
    confusion. Some questions arise: 1) Why do we need musical categories? 2)
    How are such categories created? 3) Are historical categories like 'genre'
    or 'style' useful in all contexts? 4) What is the status of terms like
    'field', 'area', 'space', 'boundary' and 'frontier'.

  Abstract: "In this essay, I examine how aspects of\_rhythm\_and metre piay a fundamental role in shaping and defining Led Zeppelin's musical style. At the same time, I will show how Led Zeppelin was able to modify, manipulate, and develop pre-existing musical models and forms through various rhythmic and metric strategies. Comparative analyses will be used in an effort to show how Led Zeppelin's flexible conception of rhythm\_and metre enabled the band to put their own stylistic 'stamp' on (i) specific musical genres ('The Crunge' and the song's relation to James Brown-style funk), (ii) their riff constructions ('Black Dog' in relation to Fleetwood Mac's 'Oh Well'), and (iii) their cover versions ('Dazed and Confused'). Drawing upon my analytical points, I revisit the complex issues that persist regarding the possibility that Led Zeppelin even has an 'original' or 'unique' style given their often overt reliance upon earlier musical models and forms. Therefore, in my conclusion, I argue that the development of any artist or group's individual style necessarily involves the ability to assimilate and transform pre-existing musical features - features such as\_rhythm\_and metre - in novel ways and where issues relating to musical style intersect with influence.\_"

  Abstract: >-
    Jimi Hendrix's work in Band of Gypsys marked an important stage in his
    later, post-Experience career. The live recording of Band of Gypsys   is a
    showcase for Hendrix's skills as an improviser and live performing artist.
    Moreover, analyses made of the four Hendrix pieces included on  Band of
    Gypsys  show the composer exploring new musical concepts while he is also
    drawing on traditional stylistic resources.                 In addition to
    focusing on the recordings of "Who Knows," "Machine Gun," "Power to Love,"
    and "Message to Love," this dissertation also uses Band of Gypsys  as a
    platform from which to view Hendrix's larger musical language, exploring
    aspects of its rich synthesis of traditional and novel stylistic
    elements.                 Chapter I gives general historical background
    relevant to the formation of Band of Gypsys.                 Chapter II,
    organized under several topical headings, gives an overview of the highly
    personalized style that Hendrix developed in both the Jimi Hendrix
    Experience and Band of Gypsys. In addition to giving information about
    Hendrix's equipment and playing techniques, Chapter II deals with signature
    guitar licks, chords, and other characteristic ways in which Hendrix
    organizes pitch materials as both composer and improviser. Historical
    information and representative examples from select recordings accompany the
    treatments of stylistic elements and playing techniques.                
    Chapter III analyzes "Who Knows" and looks at the piece's performance,
    stylistic mixture, and possible links to traditional and contemporary
    sources in blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz.                 Chapter IV
    studies "Machine Gun," a celebrated tour de force and a unique fusion of
    traditional blues and electronic sound painting.                 Chapter V
    looks at "Power to Love," a complex work whose composition is rooted in an
    earlier piece by Ray Charles.                 Chapter VI investigates
    "Message to Love," another complex, multi-thematic piece that Hendrix first
    developed with Gypsy Sun and Rainbows.                 Chapter VII concludes
    the study and offers a critical reappraisal of  Band of Gypsys  as
    representing a neotraditional work comprising linked traditional and
    progressive musical features.

    Using the rhythmic stratification theory of Maury Yeston I model the
    fundamental rhythmic drive in jazz as a combination of three particular
    types of polymeter. Using this stratification model, I describe changes in
    jazz rhythm and jazz drumming since 1930. A recording of sound examples is
    included of models created using the Max programming environment.*

  Abstract: >-
    The Concerto  for tuba and winds is intended to reflect my interest in swing
    rhythm and the way other composers have notated jazz. Through new swing
    research with emphasis on a phenomenological interpretation of a bi-metric
    system, the nature of the backbeat is demonstrated. New polyrhythmic
    notational techniques, as well as new intuitive notations are also explored.
    Multiple versions of the Concerto were created to help rehearse polymetric
    music and allow for improvisational options. Optional parts for three squads
    of dancers emphasize the exchange of energy involved in swing and scat
    lyrics for instrumental parts offer more precise indications of jazz
    inflection. The Concerto is virtuosic work in three movements that musically
    demonstrates new swing notation techniques in modern wind ensemble setting.

  Abstract: >-
    The recordings and performances of Cal Tjader in the 1950s and 1960s made
    him one of the leaders of the Latin Jazz movement. Though he would
    eventually be known for his interpretations of a wide range of Latin
    American musics, it was the mambos, cha-chas and other Cuban styles of
    Machito and Tito Puente that first captured his interest in 1953. This paper
    analyzes how Tjader developed as an improviser in the Latin Jazz style by
    utilizing profound understandings of both American jazz and Latin
    music.                 Chapter I outlines Tjader's early musical career and
    his discovery of Latin music. Chapter II examines the elements that Tjader
    incorporated in his playing during the first five years of his recording as
    a bandleader. Chapter III focuses on one particular recording, "A Night in
    Tunisia" from Tjader's  Monterey Concerts  and shows how he blended the
    elements from Chapter II into a mature musical style. The appendices include
    transcriptions and a discography.

We then calculated higher-level rhyme\_  features and used them to compare rhyming styles in song lyrics from different genres,\_  and for different rap artists. We found that these detected features corresponded to real-world descriptions of rhyming style and were strongly characteristic of different\_  rappers, resulting in potential applications to style-based comparison, music\_  recommendation, and authorship identification.\_"

    including Henry Cowell's treatise New musical resources (1930) and jazz. The
    stratification of musical time embodies the quality of multidimensionality,
    the discrete temporal processes of simultaneous musical layers.
    Multidimensionality is evident in the processes of accumulation, canon, and
    heterophony, and is a prerequisite for temporal dissonance. Nancarrow
    discusses temporal dissonance with regard to the proportions of the
    differing tempos of concurrent layers, but the concept can have a broader
    application to include notions of simultaneity, reconcilability, and canonic
    process. Excerpts of all the studies are analyzed, but the focus is turned
    toward study no. 41, which features highly complex and dense textures,
    mosaic-like arch forms, and a fragmented temporal dissonance.

  Abstract: >-
    Jazz, from its origins until World War II, was America's hot new music of
    the 20th c., and this music spread like wildfire to Europe and beyond.
    Shortly after the war ended a calming influence manifested itself in jazz
    and a new genre emerged with its own soundscape and quickly rose to
    worldwide popularity and influence-Cool Jazz. This book traces the history
    of this music to its roots in French Impressionism and European
    Neo-Classicism, describes the key roles played by Bix Beiderbecke, Lester
    Young, Lennie Tristano, Claude Thornhill, and Dave Brubeck in the
    development of this genre, and focuses on the major figures associated with
    a group of landmark recordings and on an ensemble that felicitously came to
    be known as The Birth of the Cool. The contributions of Miles Davis, Gil
    Evans, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, and John Carisi are considered in detail,
    and the scores of this music, arranged for Davis's nine-piece band, are
    analyzed and compared.

  Abstract: >-
    This thesis provides a historical and contextual basis for seven original
    jazz-fusion compositions. The thesis is divided into three sections. Section
    one examines the key musical elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, form,
    and instrumentation found in jazz-fusion. Section two is a reflection of the
    historical development of jazz-fusion and how it has influenced my own work.
    Section three analyzes the melody, harmony, rhythm, and form of my
    compositions. The thesis concludes with a contextualization of these
    compositions in relation to contemporary jazz-fusion music. The appendix of
    this thesis includes complete scores of the compositions and is accompanied
    by a CD of recorded performances.

  Abstract: >-
    The seven compositions for jazz piano trio that comprise the "creative work"
    portion of this thesis were written over a period of eighteen months and
    reflect my interest in a broad range of piano styles related to the jazz
    tradition, including boogie-woogie, stride, bebop, "modal," and "free." The
    pieces can be performed individually, or as a concert suite, and are united
    by the source of their inspiration, that being the poetry of Al
    Purdy.                 Reading the selected poems out loud, I was able to
    generate simple rhythmic motives to which I later applied pitches, thus
    generating the basic melodic vocabulary from which each piece developed. If
    the compositions are programmatic, then they are so only in that decisions
    were made concerning the basic character of each piece based on the subject
    matter and flavour of each individual poem. At all times during the
    composition process I kept in mind that the resulting pieces would need to
    have utility for myself as a pianist, and that each piece should serve as a
    springboard for improvisation within the stylistic parameters established at
    the outset.                 Since this thesis involves the poetry of Al
    Purdy I begin with a chapter that draws attention to aspects of the poetry
    and the public persona of its creator that resonate strongly for a jazz
    musician. A second chapter offers my reflections on the diversity of
    composers drawing inspiration from works of literature (poetry in
    particular), demonstrating the variety of approaches undertaken by different
    artists, and emphasizing how the results "embody" their sources of
    inspiration to varying degrees. Finally, the seven compositions are profiled
    in individual chapters that outline their development. Four appendices
    supply supplementary information, and audio recordings of all the
    compositions are provided.

  Abstract: >-
    This thesis uses a framework of basic elements of music (rhythm, form,
    harmony, and melody) to illustrate a variety of concepts of interest to me
    in my composition. These concepts include polymeter, polyrhythm, upper
    structures, inversion of seventh chords in relationship to counterpoint,
    melodic phrase lengths and shapes, suspensions/delayed resolution,
    pointillism, and problems with notation. Application of these concepts in
    the compositional process, including intellectual and intuitive approaches
    and decision-making, will be illustrated. Influences of significance to my
    compositions, both musical and experiential, will also be discussed. The
    thesis is presented with a view that study is eternal: the expression of any
    idea in a composition is part of a learning cycle and will appear at a
    singular stage in my development. As such, directions for current and future
    work are indicated.
